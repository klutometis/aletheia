# Aletheia (Ἀλήθεια)

**Truth. Disclosure. Unconcealment.**

Aletheia is an AI-powered tool for **living an examined life**—helping you articulate your deepest values through structured philosophical inquiry, reach stable positions through Socratic dialogue, and make decisions aligned with what you truly believe.

## The Problem

Modern life presents us with a paradox: we hold strong moral commitments—about work, family, technology, justice—yet we struggle to articulate *why* we hold them or *what grounds them*. Philosopher Charles Taylor calls this **modern inarticulation**: we inherit fragments of conflicting moral frameworks (religious, rationalist, expressivist) without understanding how they fit together or what empowers our deepest convictions.

This inarticulation isn't just intellectually unsatisfying—it's **existentially destabilizing**. Without articulable moral sources, we become:
- **Fragmented**: holding values that pull in different directions
- **Vulnerable**: unable to sustain commitments when challenged  
- **Alienated**: living by sources we can't acknowledge to ourselves

## The Solution: Erotetic Equilibrium Through AI Philosophy Tutors

Aletheia builds on philosopher Philipp Koralus's concept of **erotetic equilibrium**—the state where your views remain stable across an appropriate range of questions. Unlike traditional "AI alignment" approaches that nudge you toward predetermined outcomes, Aletheia acts as a **philosophy tutor**, helping you discover and own your positions through catalytic questioning.

### Three Modes of Engagement

**1. Philosophical Exploration**  
Navigate interactive inquiry complexes—graphs of interconnected questions on contested domains like "competence in the age of AI" or "privacy vs. security." See how questions relate, discover your positions through Socratic dialogue, and understand where you stand relative to different intellectual camps.

**2. Moral Source Articulation**  
Go deeper than surface positions. Using Taylor's framework, Aletheia helps you understand the *sources* that empower your commitments—whether theistic (divine moral order), naturalist (rational dignity), or expressivist (authentic self-realization). Discover tensions between sources you're drawing on and develop a coherent moral framework.

**3. Decision Support**  
When facing real choices, consult your examined values. Rather than algorithmic recommendations or "nudges," Aletheia asks: "Would you still choose this if you considered X?" Your articulated values guide decisions, but you remain autonomous—the system helps you reach *your* equilibrium, not someone else's.

## Why This Matters: Autonomy-Preserving AI

Most AI systems steer behavior through hidden optimization (engagement, revenue, "alignment"). Aletheia is different:

✅ **Transparency**: You see the inquiry structure, the questions, the alternatives  
✅ **Ownership**: Changes in view preserve autonomy when they help you seek equilibrium  
✅ **Community-Grounded**: Questions sourced from actual intellectual communities, not corporate objectives  
✅ **Truth-Seeking**: The telos is understanding, not manipulation  

This is **philosophy** (helping you think clearly) not **rhetoric** (steering you toward predetermined ends).

## Current Status: Prototype

The app currently implements:
- Interactive graph visualization of inquiry complexes (Cytoscape.js)
- Socratic dialogue with Gemini for exploring questions
- Real-time answer extraction and position recording
- Progress tracking toward erotetic equilibrium
- Mobile-responsive with hamburger menu

**Active domain**: "Competence in the Age of AI" (10 seed questions)

Coming soon:
- Pattern articulation using Taylor's moral sources framework
- Stability testing (do your positions remain stable when re-examined?)
- Consistency checking (are your answers logically coherent?)
- Decision support mode (consult your examined values for real choices)

## Philosophical Foundations

**Charles Taylor** (*Sources of the Self*, 1989): Modern identity crisis stems from inarticulation about moral sources. We need to recover the capacity to understand what grounds our commitments.

**Philipp Koralus** (*Reason and Inquiry*, 2023; "The Philosophic Turn for AI Agents", 2025): Erotetic equilibrium provides a rigorous framework for truth-seeking through questioning. AI systems should help users reach equilibrium on their own terms, not nudge them toward external objectives.

**Oxford HAI Lab**: Built on PyETR (Python implementation of Erotetic Theory of Reasoning) and etr_case_generator, extending from static test cases to interactive philosophical practice.
