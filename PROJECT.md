# Project Outline: Self-Tuning Erotetic Agent Networks for Value Articulation

**Duration:** 12-15 months

**Core Research Question:** Can decentralized networks of LLM-powered agents facilitate Taylorian value articulation through erotetic equilibrium, while resisting demand characteristics and surviving model evolution?

## Primary Deliverables

1. **Scholarly manuscript** on erotetic agent orchestration, addressing the Fusion Problem and demand characteristics in human-AI philosophical dialogue (target: philosophy of AI or cognitive science venue)

2. **Open-source framework** implementing erotetic theory primitives (inquiry complexes, equilibrium detection, adversarial probing) with self-tuning capabilities

3. **Empirical study** comparing single-agent vs. multi-agent value articulation across communities, with behavioral validation measures

## Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1-4)

**Goal:** Establish viability of single-agent erotetic inquiry and framework requirements.

**Milestones:**
- **Framework evaluation study:** Systematic comparison of LangGraph, base models + tools, and CrewAI for implementing erotetic primitives (question generation, reframing tests, equilibrium detection)
- **Single-agent prototype:** Working system that helps users articulate one value domain (e.g., work-life balance) with counterfactual probing
- **Demand characteristics measurement:** Pilot study identifying behavioral signatures distinguishing appeasement from genuine articulation

**Deliverable:** Technical report documenting framework requirements for erotetic agents and initial prototype results.

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Coordination (Months 5-9)

**Goal:** Solve the Fusion Problem for 2-3 agent orchestration and demonstrate self-tuning.

**Milestones:**
- **Fusion Problem solution:** Explicit coordination mechanism allowing agents with different inquiry complexes to cooperate without vicious recursion
- **Self-tuning experiments:** DSPy-based optimization of prompt sequences, tested across model versions (Gemini 2.5 variants, Claude)
- **Community inquiry complex integration:** Pilot with 2-3 real communities (e.g., effective altruism, philosophical counseling) to source and validate inquiry complexes
- **Small-scale empirical study:** 20-30 participants using single vs. multi-agent systems, measuring erotetic equilibrium achievement and appeasement detection

**Deliverable:** Working multi-agent system and preliminary empirical results.

## Phase 3: Full System and Validation (Months 10-15)

**Goal:** Demonstrate decentralized network at scale and produce publishable findings.

**Milestones:**
- **Decentralized orchestration:** 5-7 agent network with Hayekian adaptation (agents learn from users/each other without central control)
- **Behavioral validation study:** Longitudinal tracking (3+ months) of articulated values vs. actual choices, prediction accuracy
- **Cross-community study:** Test system with diverse communities, measuring whether community-specific inquiry complexes improve articulation quality
- **Vision Pro visualization prototype:** 3D graph visualization of erotetic networks for debugging and understanding emergence

**Deliverables:**
- **Manuscript:** "Erotetic Agent Networks: Facilitating Value Articulation While Resisting Rhetorical Collapse" - theoretical framework, empirical results, analysis of demand characteristics problem
- **Code release:** Open-source framework with documentation, example inquiry complexes, evaluation metrics
- **Demo system:** Public prototype allowing users to experiment with value articulation using multiple inquiry complex sources

## Risk Mitigation

**If high-level frameworks prove inadequate:** Pivot to base models + explicit orchestration, treating framework development itself as research contribution.

**If demand characteristics prove insurmountable:** Reframe as negative result with theoretical significance (limits of LLM-mediated philosophy), publish analysis of the problem.

**If self-tuning doesn't scale:** Document why, propose alternative robustness mechanisms, contribute to DSPy/agent orchestration literature.

## Significance

This addresses gaps in three literatures: (1) AI alignment through value learning, (2) agent orchestration and the Fusion Problem, (3) computational philosophy and truth-seeking systems. The demand characteristics analysis alone contributes novel insights into human-AI collaborative epistemology.

## Personal Context

The principal investigator expects to be a user of the erotetic software developed through this project. Specifically, I intend to use it to rigorously test and refine my philosophical formulations around peirastic/poietic, base/heroic, and banausic/liberal alignments of LLMs—moving these from intuitive categories developed through public engagement to formally articulated frameworks with empirical validation. Having spent 3+ years thinking through philosophical implications of LLMs while building them, and engaging with the Western canon as a framework for understanding these systems, there is a genuine need for tools that facilitate rigorous value articulation without collapsing into appeasement or rhetoric. The demand characteristics problem discovered empirically through lilpaiper.ai affects the researcher's own interactions with AI systems. This is not merely academic research but an attempt to build infrastructure for the kind of philosophical-technical work the researcher needs to do.
