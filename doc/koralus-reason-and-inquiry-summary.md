## Executive Summary

Philipp Koralus's 'Reason and Inquiry' presents a groundbreaking, interdisciplinary theory of human reason, directly confronting the paradox that reason is both a powerful enabler of civilization and science, and simultaneously prone to systematic, predictable, and internal failures. The work's central argument is that a comprehensive understanding of reason must account for both its successes and its persistent flaws within a single, unified computational framework.

### 1. Main Themes and Arguments

The core theme of 'Reason and Inquiry' is the **reconciliation of reason's dual nature**: how a system capable of immense intellectual achievements can also exhibit pervasive irrationalities. Koralus critiques existing theories of rationality (classical logic, probability theory, mental logic, Bayesianism, bounded optimality) for failing to provide a **unified, domain-general computational theory** that explains both human triumphs and systematic errors. He argues that these traditional approaches often define reason by its ideal *achievements* (a "Humean" view) rather than its internal *capacity* (a "Kantian" view) and are computationally intractable or empirically mismatched with human performance.

Koralus proposes the **Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR)** as a foundational alternative. The ETR posits that reason's fundamental operation is the capacity to **raise issues (questions) and answer them** in a way that reduces complexity. Failures of reason, he argues, are not due to external limitations or separate "irrational" systems, but are *internal* to reason's nature, often stemming from **insufficient inquisitiveness** or neglecting alternative possibilities. The theory further asserts that reason *can self-correct* to achieve "classically correct judgment" (logical validity, probabilistic coherence, rational choice) by fully applying its internal principles, specifically by reaching **erotetic equilibrium**—a state where judgments are robust to further questioning.

Ultimately, the book argues for a **content-based theory of reason**, where mental representations ("views") structurally correspond to their contents and are dynamically updated by reasoning operations. This framework positions classical rationality as a special, ideal case of erotetic reasoning achieved under conditions of exhaustive inquiry.

### 2. Key Concepts and Principles

*   **Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR):** Reason's fundamental capacity is to raise issues (questions, represented as sets of alternative states) and answer them.
*   **Views:** The fundamental mental representations. These are formal structures (sets of alternative states, with suppositions, dependency relations, and issue structures for predicate logic, and weights for probabilities) that directly correspond to their content.
*   **Erotetic Equilibrium:** The normative ideal of the ETR. A judgment is in equilibrium if it is robust and would not change if further relevant issues were raised. Achieving this state guarantees classical logical soundness, probabilistic coherence, and rational choice.
*   **Restricted Erotetic Equilibrium:** A more pragmatic standard, where judgments are in equilibrium only with respect to a defined "Topic of Inquiry." This explains context-dependent rationality and why seemingly fallacious inferences can be rational in specific situations (e.g., generics).
*   **Arbitrary Objects:** A key innovation (from Kit Fine) for predicate logic, allowing finite mental models to represent infinite domains and universal statements (e.g., "an arbitrary dog" for "all dogs bark").
*   **Reasoning Operations:** A formal calculus of operations that dynamically transform views, including:
    *   **`Answer`:** The primary mechanism for reducing the set of alternatives (reducing "questionyness") based on new information.
    *   **`Inquire`:** An effortful operation that explicitly raises new alternatives or polar questions, crucial for moving towards erotetic equilibrium and avoiding illusory inferences.
    *   **`Query`:** An operation to check if a conclusion follows, often based on suppositional reasoning.
    *   **`Product` (`⊗`) and `Sum` (`⊕`):** Operations corresponding to conjunction and disjunction, respectively, which manipulate sets of states and their dependencies.
    *   **`Factor`:** Simplifies views by eliminating absurd states or factoring out generalizations.
    *   **`Suppose` and `Depose`:** Operations for handling hypothetical reasoning.
*   **Default Procedure:** The standard, often less effortful, sequence of operations that explains systematic human reasoning patterns, including many fallacies.
*   **Equilibrium Answer Potential (EAP):** For probabilistic reasoning, it quantifies the "claim to answer" a question, reflecting graded uncertainty.
*   **Double-Weights:** For practical reasoning, allowing for both multiplicative probabilities and additive priorities.
*   **Inquisitive Load:** The cognitive burden (number of additional questions) required to achieve an equilibrium judgment. High inquisitive load can undermine agency.
*   **Competence:** The ETR focuses on an underlying, counterfactually robust internal structure of reason, rather than mere behavioral success.

### 3. Important Examples or Case Studies

Koralus employs numerous empirical examples to illustrate both successes and failures of reason:

*   **Inferential Failures:**
    *   **Base-Rate Neglect:** "Psylicrapitis" problem (disease testing), where people ignore prevalence rates.
    *   **Illusory Inferences:** From disjunctions ("Jane kneels and looks at TV or Mark stands and peers; Jane kneels" -> "Jane is looking at the TV").
    *   **Wason Selection Task:** Explaining why abstract versions are hard and "realistic" versions are easier due to background questions.
    *   **Conjunction Fallacy:** "Linda Problem" (judging "Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement" more probable than "Linda is a bank teller").
    *   **Affirming the Consequent:** In propositional and quantified contexts.
    *   **Quantified Illusory Inferences:** "Some A's are B; X is an A; Therefore X is B," including the "Politician's Syllogism."
*   **Decision-Making Failures:**
    *   **Framing Effects:** "Asian Disease Problem" (choosing between programs that save/lose lives), child custody case (choosing vs. rejecting the same parent).
    *   **Endowment Effect:** People value items they own more highly.
    *   **Opportunity Cost Neglect:** Failing to consider alternative purchases.
    *   **Decoy Effect:** An inferior third option influencing choice between two others.
*   **Successful Reasoning & Beyond:**
    *   **Bayesian Updating:** The ETR shows how naïve reasoners can perform Bayesian updating without explicit formulas, by following the theory's operations.
    *   **Generics:** "Sharks attack bathers" to explain how logically vacuous statements can have inferential power in restricted contexts.
    *   **Superforecasters:** Their cognitive policies are interpreted as strategies for reducing inquisitive load and approaching erotetic equilibrium.
    *   **Affordances:** Direct perception of action possibilities.
    *   **Risk Pollution:** How interconnected systems impose insurmountable inquisitive load on human managers.
    *   **Deliberative Democracy:** Seen as a mechanism to facilitate collective movement towards erotetic equilibrium.

### 4. Overview of the Work's Structure and Contribution

'Reason and Inquiry' is structured logically, starting with the problem, critiquing existing solutions, and then systematically building the Erotetic Theory of Reason.

*   **Introduction & Critique:** Chapters begin by setting the stage for reason's paradox and then rigorously dismantling competing theories (ideal rationality, mental logic, Bayesianism, bounded optimality) across propositional, predicate, and probabilistic domains.
*   **Core Theory Development:** Initial chapters establish the fundamental ETR concepts (views, content-representation correspondence, arbitrary objects, basic operations like `Answer`, `Inquire`, `Query`).
*   **Formal Calculus Expansion:** The book progressively formalizes the ETR, developing a sophisticated 'view calculus' for propositional logic, then extending it to predicate logic (with quantifiers and complex dependency relations), and finally to reasoning with graded uncertainty (probabilities and weighted views).
*   **Practical Reasoning & Agency:** Later sections apply the ETR to decision-making, introducing "doings," "priority views," and "double-weights." It explores the role of affordances and emotions in regulating inquiry and highlights the impact of "inquisitive load" on individual and collective agency, with implications for democracy and societal organization.
*   **Meta-Theoretical Validation (Appendices):** The concluding appendices provide rigorous formal proofs of the ETR's well-definedness, soundness (it preserves truth under ideal conditions), completeness (it can derive all classical logical truths under ideal conditions), and conservativity (how the extended weighted system relates to its classical counterpart).

**Contribution:**

Koralus's 'Reason and Inquiry' makes several significant contributions:

1.  **Unified Explanation:** It offers the first truly unified, domain-general computational theory that can rigorously explain both the remarkable successes and the systematic, internal failures of human intelligence, bridging the gap between normative logic and empirical cognitive science.
2.  **Formal Rigor:** It provides a mathematically precise and formally clear theory (the 'view calculus') capable of generating testable predictions and proving meta-theoretical properties like soundness and completeness.
3.  **Reframing Rationality:** It redefines classical notions of logical validity, probabilistic coherence, and rational choice not as independent ideals, but as emergent properties of reasoning under **erotetic equilibrium**, a state of exhaustive and robust inquiry.
4.  **Novel Concepts:** It introduces powerful conceptual tools like **arbitrary objects** (solving the cardinality problem for finite minds representing infinite domains) and **inquisitive load** (explaining threats to agency and highlighting the cognitive demands of modern life).
5.  **Interdisciplinary Synthesis:** By drawing on insights from philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, AI, cognitive psychology, and behavioral economics, it provides a powerful example of a truly interdisciplinary approach to understanding human reason, applicable to *any* intelligent system.

## Individual Section Summaries

### Section 1

Philipp Koralus's introduction to 'Reason and Inquiry' establishes reason as a fundamental and paradoxical human "superpower," enabling science, technology, civilization, and the capacity for "change in view" without external input. However, Koralus argues that reason is also inherently flawed, subject to **systematic and predictable failures** that are *internal* to its nature, rather than mere capacity limitations. The book's central challenge is to reconcile this dual nature: how can a system capable of such immense achievements also exhibit pervasive irrationalities?

Koralus proposes the **Erotetic Theory of Reason** as a foundational alternative to classical logic, probability theory, or 'reasonable behavior,' which he views as *achievements* of reason, not its basis. The theory's core is the capacity to **raise issues and answer them** in a way that reduces complexity. Its three core propositions are:
1.  This erotetic process is more fundamental and general than logic or probability theory.
2.  Systematic failures of reason are real and internal to its nature.
3.  Reason can self-correct, overcoming failures and achieving "classically correct judgment" (valid inference, probabilistic coherence, rational choice) by fully applying its internal principles, specifically by reaching **erotetic equilibrium**—a state where judgments are robust to further issues.

Failures primarily stem from **insufficient inquisitiveness** or neglecting alternative possibilities in straightforward cases, analogous to visual illusions revealing deeper structures of perception. Koralus highlights reason's **domain-generality** (applying to all subjects, facts, and actions), its **recursive nature**, and its ability to lead to **novel judgments** and decisions.

Drawing on interdisciplinary insights (philosophy, neuroscience, linguistics, AI, cognitive psychology, behavioral economics), the book aims to build a rigorous, formally clear theory that explains both the successes and the persistent flaws of human intelligence, using empirical data and examples like logical puzzles and probability fallacies. This approach suggests that the structures accounting for human rationality's limits might be generally relevant for *any* intelligent system.

### Section 2

This section of Koralus's 'Reason and Inquiry' demonstrates the systematic and internal flaws of human reason and then critiques existing theories of ideal rationality for failing to account for these flaws and for the practicalities of a domain-general intelligent system.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Systematic Failures of Human Reason:**
    *   **Base-Rate Neglect:** Illustrated by the "psylicrapitis" problem, people consistently overestimate the probability of having a disease after a positive test result, neglecting the low prevalence (base rate) of the disease in the population. This error is widespread, even among professionals, and can have severe consequences. Koralus highlights that reason fundamentally misuses conditional probabilities in these cases, treating them as directly settling the main question.
    *   **Framing Effects in Decision-Making:** Shown by the sole-custody case, how a question is framed ("award" vs. "deny") can significantly alter decisions, even when the objective choice scenario is identical. This suggests decisions are often made at "face value," without fully considering the implications of available choices.

2.  **The Dual Challenge:** These examples underscore the book's central challenge: a satisfactory theory of reason must explain both humans' remarkable capacity for systematic success *and* their systematic, predictable failures. Traditional approaches (logic, probability, decision theory) are deemed insufficient.

3.  **The Need for a Computational Theory (Marr's Framework):**
    *   Koralus advocates for a "computational theory" of human reason (Marr's Type 1 problem), which specifies the system's *aim*, the *mapping* it computes, and *why* it computes it, rather than just describing observable behavior.
    *   The **Erotetic Theory of Reason** (ETR) is positioned as this computational theory, proposing that reason's core function is to "map issues and putative answers to (hopefully) smaller issues," functioning as a *question-answer system*. This implicitly suggests a "functional core" of reason that is a Type 1 problem, even if general intelligence is more complex.

4.  **Critique of Ideal Rationality (Humean Approaches):**
    *   Koralus contrasts the dominant "Humean" approach (defining reason by reasonable behavior, often tied to mathematical ideals) with his "Kantian" approach (defining reason as a capacity, embracing internal flaws).
    *   He argues that standard mathematical notions of ideal rationality (e.g., utility maximization, calculative rationality) are unsuitable as theories of domain-general reason due to:
        *   **Computational Intractability:** They ignore resource limitations (time, processing), leading to "combinatorial explosion" for real-world problems. Even meta-reasoning doesn't resolve this.
        *   **Bounded Optimality's Limitations:** While acknowledging resource constraints, it struggles with:
            *   **Cognitive Slack:** Humans often fail to optimize even within their resources, yet we still attribute reason to them.
            *   **Shallow Success:** Simply being "good" (satisficing) can be achieved by narrow or accidental competence, not necessarily domain-general intelligence.
            *   **Undefined Parameters:** For general intelligence, defining the "environment" and "performance measure" becomes arbitrarily difficult, trivializing the concept.

In essence, this section sets the stage by illustrating the empirical reality of systematic irrationality and then clearing the theoretical field by demonstrating why existing ideal models fail to provide a robust, domain-general computational theory capable of explaining reason's dual nature. The Erotetic Theory is presented as the promising alternative, grounded in a "Kantian" view of reason's internal, question-answering structure.

### Section 3

This section deepens Koralus's critique of existing theories of reason, arguing that neither "ideal rationality" nor psychological approaches offer a satisfactory computational theory of domain-general reason, especially in light of systematic human flaws.

**1. Limitations of Bounded Optimality:**
Koralus first extends his critique of bounded optimality, noting its difficulty in defining a "global performance measure" and "environment" for domain-general intelligence. He introduces the **"fusion problem,"** where a collection of individually boundedly optimal special-purpose systems does not automatically combine into a globally boundedly optimal general system without an additional, complex "scheduler" system. Therefore, while useful for specific AI engineering problems, bounded optimality fails to define domain-general reason.

**2. Critique of Mental Logic Theories:**
Mental logic theories (e.g., Rips) propose reason is underwritten by a psychologically real natural deduction system. Koralus identifies two key problems:
*   **Lack of Direction:** Mental logic is verification-oriented; it tells us what *follows* from premises, but not what to *infer* or how to arrive at *novel conclusions*, a hallmark of human reason.
*   **Plato's Problem:** If mental logic includes fallacious rules (to explain errors), how can reason learn to self-correct and abandon these rules? If it doesn't, how do systematic fallacies occur? The persistence of errors even among experts suggests "defective bits" aren't simply "dropped."
    *   Koralus rejects **dual-systems theories** (e.g., System 1/System 2) as a solution, arguing they merely defer Plato's problem by postulating a rational system governing irrational ones without explaining *how* this governance or learning occurs ("dormitive powers").
    *   He advocates for a **unified-system explanation** that can account for both successes and failures, viewing breakdowns as core to understanding reason's principles, and suggesting his Erotetic Theory can explain how question-asking (e.g., in argumentation) improves reasoning.

**3. Critique of Bayesianism:**
Bayesianism, a prominent computational theory in cognitive science, claims human inference approximates Bayesian probabilistic inference. Koralus challenges this:
*   **Empirical Mismatch:** Humans are notoriously bad at explicit Bayesian inference problems (e.g., base-rate neglect), even professionals, demonstrating systematic fallacies where the theory should fit best.
*   **Reliance on Heuristics and the Aim-Approximation Gap:** Bayesians often explain human behavior via heuristics that are *approximations* of Bayesian principles. Koralus argues this approach suffers from the "fusion problem" (local approximations don't guarantee global coherence) and the **"aim-approximation gap"** (a system approximating a function isn't necessarily *aiming* at that function). He suggests the Erotetic Theory can yield Bayesian-equivalent results without Bayesian coherence being the primary aim.
*   **Not Domain-General:** A collection of approximate Bayesian heuristics for specific problems does not constitute a domain-general computational theory of reason, but rather a Type 2 (algorithmic) theory. While potentially adequate for sensory-motor systems, its applicability to higher cognition remains questionable.

**4. Turing Test, Chinese Room, and Understanding:**
Briefly, Koralus touches on the Turing Test as an operational definition of thinking, noting its historical connection to behaviorism and the now-refuted "blank slate" view of human development. He then uses Searle's Chinese Room argument to highlight that merely exhibiting correct input-output relations (passing the Turing Test) does not guarantee "understanding," which he sees as integral to a full-blown notion of reason. This underscores the challenge in defining and mimicking human-like general intelligence.

In conclusion, Koralus argues that contemporary "ideal rationality" approaches (bounded optimality, mental logic, Bayesianism) fundamentally fail to provide a **unified, domain-general computational theory of reason** that accounts for both human successes and systematic, internal failures. These critiques set the stage for the Erotetic Theory as a promising alternative capable of explaining the dual nature of human reason.

### Section 4

This section deepens the exploration of what constitutes genuine "understanding" for a theory of reason, ultimately shifting focus from "understanding" to "competence."

**1. Reinterpreting "Understanding" as "Competence":**
Koralus dismisses Searle's emphasis on phenomenal consciousness for "understanding," proposing instead that what's crucial for reason is **competence**. Competence, unlike mere correct input-output patterns (like the Chinese Room), implies an underlying, counterfactually robust internal structure that would yield appropriate outputs even with varying inputs. This is analogous to how a good exam tests underlying knowledge, not just rote answers.

**2. Craik's "Thought Models" and Structural Correspondence:**
He introduces Craik's concept of "thought models" that possess a "similar relation-structure" to what they represent and "work in the same way in essential respects." This structural correspondence is key to defining competence. A variant Chinese Room experiment (with a model railway) illustrates that evidence of such internal structural fidelity and counterfactual robustness *increases* our willingness to attribute competence, unlike Minsky's broader definition of mental models, which Koralus finds too weak.

**3. Johnson-Laird's Mental Model Theory (MMT) as a Foundation:**
Johnson-Laird's MMT is highlighted as the most systematic psychological development of Craik's idea, positing that mental models *have the same structure as their contents*. MMT successfully explains human reasoning patterns, including errors (like "illusory inferences" from missing alternatives) and the impact of premise order. Koralus argues that MMT's structural approach better supports the necessary counterfactuals for attributing competence than traditional logical forms (e.g., representing P&Q as a set {P,Q} rather than a formula 'P&Q' for conjunction).

**4. Defending the Structural/Competence Approach:**
Koralus defends this view against three objections:
*   **Quinean Indeterminacy:** Against the idea that there's no fact of the matter about internal structure, he cites modern linguistic theory (Chomsky) which focuses on internalized rule systems.
*   **Computational String-Based Limits:** He argues that computation isn't limited to linear string transformations (Turing machines); it can involve operations like set formation (as in Chomsky's Minimalist Program).
*   **Infinite Regress/Holism:** He counters that competence doesn't require mirroring an entire human mind or infinite definitions, citing the "externalist revolution" in philosophy which posits that not all concepts are intrinsically tied to vast networks of others.

**5. Ethical Implications of Competence-Based AI:**
Koralus argues that, ethically, decisions in critical areas like hiring or criminal justice should be based on **competence**, not just statistical correlation from purely data-driven AI, as the latter may lack the necessary counterfactual robustness. He suggests anaphora resolution in language may function as an indirect test of a listener's underlying competence.

**6. Transition to a Content-Based Theory of Reason:**
While acknowledging MMT's strengths, Koralus seeks to move beyond its limitations to a more general **computational theory of reason**. MMT, he notes, lacks formal definitions for arbitrary logical problems and struggles with how finite mental models represent infinite domains (e.g., "all dogs bark" with "mental footnotes").

**7. The Principle of Content-Representation Correspondence and Arbitrary Objects:**
Koralus proposes a **content-based theory of reason** where reason operates directly on "contents" or "views," assuming that the underlying mental representations *have the same structure as their contents* (the **principle of content-representation correspondence**). To address the **cardinality problem** (how finite cognitive states represent infinite domains), he introduces Kit Fine's concept of **arbitrary objects**. General statements are understood as involving arbitrary objects (e.g., "all dogs bark" means thinking about an arbitrary dog that barks), allowing for finite mental content to capture universal truths.

### Section 5

Koralus advances his **content-based theory of reason**, building on the idea that mental representations structurally correspond to their contents. He briefly defends the use of **arbitrary objects** (introduced in the previous section) as a scientifically useful concept for representing universal truths with finite mental content, despite potential ontological concerns.

The core of the Erotetic Theory posits that representational contents, termed **"views,"** are fundamentally **sets of alternative states** or **"issues" (questions)**. These "states" roughly represent putative facts, including inconsistent ones, and differ from traditional "possible worlds" by allowing for distinctions between logically equivalent but cognitively non-identical contents, which is crucial for explaining reasoning effort and fallacies.

The theory defines reasoning as the capacity to modify these views by applying **reasoning operations**, or "lenses," which are determined solely by the content of the views. These operations are conceptualized as update procedures (e.g., G[D]° = G') that can either *reduce* the "questionyness" (making views less inquisitive by narrowing alternatives) or *increase* it (by adding alternatives).

The **Erotetic Theory of Reason** is guided by five core principles:
1.  **Content-based changes in view:** Reasoning operates directly on representational contents (views).
2.  **Directed inference lenses:** Operations transform views from one perspective to another.
3.  **Answerhood:** The primary aim is to answer issues as directly as possible, by treating new premises or commitments as maximally strong answers, thereby reducing the set of alternative possibilities.
4.  **Erotetic Equilibrium:** The secondary aim is to weakly pursue a state where a judgment is robust and would not change even if further issues were raised. This external notion guarantees classical soundness, probabilistic coherence, and rational choice under idealization, acting as a "fragile hope" for finite agents, prompted by signals of disequilibrium.
5.  **Erotetic Disequilibrium:** All human fallacies (unwarranted judgments) are explained as inferences made outside of erotetic equilibrium, typically due to not asking enough questions. Failures of omission arise from entertaining inappropriate issues.

Koralus further outlines four **Principles of core reasoning performance**:
*   **Default strategy:** Explains systematic patterns in reasoning (including fallacious ones) through simple default procedures.
*   **Creative inquiry:** Accounts for individual differences in performance based on the strategic raising of issues.
*   **Erotetic complexity:** The likelihood of an inference is inversely proportional to the "inquisitiveness" (number of alternative states) of its result.
*   **View-change complexity:** Inference likelihood is inversely proportional to the number of view changes required.

Ultimately, Koralus frames a content-based theory of reason as comprising three aspects: (1) a **theory of views** (partial contents as objects of reason), (2) a **theory of the dynamics of reason** (explaining view changes via the erotetic aim of raising and answering issues), and (3) a **view calculus** (the formal mechanism for these operations). This framework aims to provide a unified explanation for both the successes and systematic failures of human reason as a competence system.

### Section 6

This section formally introduces the **view calculus**—the mathematical framework for the Erotetic Theory of Reason—and its foundational definitions for propositional reasoning.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Purpose of the View Calculus:** A content-based theory of reason requires a formal view calculus to precisely articulate view dynamics, calculate predictions, and prove global properties like classical soundness under ideal conditions (Erotetic Equilibrium).
2.  **Complexity and Simulation:** Koralus acknowledges that expressing a rich theory of human reasoning in basic mathematical terms will appear complex, comparing it to low-level programming code for high-level concepts. He stresses the crucial role of **computer simulations** (like the fishery fleet agent-based model) in understanding the emergent, complex adaptive behaviors of agents guided by the erotetic theory, beyond simple "toy problems."
3.  **Roadmap for Subsequent Chapters:** The book will progressively build the erotetic theory:
    *   **Chapter 2:** Develops propositional reasoning with "and," "not," "or," introducing **absolute erotetic equilibrium** (guaranteeing classical soundness) and **restricted erotetic equilibrium** (allowing for non-classical rational inference).
    *   **Chapter 3:** Addresses reasoning with "if," including an account of confirmation bias (e.g., Wason's card task).
    *   **Chapter 4:** Extends to first-order predicate reasoning, explaining complex inference patterns like the "Politician's syllogism" and accounting for generic statements.
    *   **Chapter 5:** Covers reasoning with uncertainty, explaining probabilistic fallacies and coherence.
    *   **Chapter 6:** Applies the theory to decision-making and practical reasoning, explaining framing effects and how erotetic equilibrium can secure classically rational choice.
4.  **Addressing Illusory Inferences:** Koralus begins with the "Illusory inference from disjunction" (e.g., 90% of participants fallaciously infer "Jane is looking at the TV" from "Either Jane kneels and looks at TV or Mark stands and peers; Jane kneels").
    *   He **rejects common explanations** like exclusive "or" or embedded exhaustivity implicatures, using a variant with "at least" and noting the importance of premise order.
    *   The Erotetic Theory explains these fallacies as a default behavior of reason: it aims to **answer issues as directly as possible** with available information. The initial premise is treated as an issue (a set of alternatives), and subsequent premises are taken as maximally strong answers, reducing the alternatives and sometimes leading to unwarranted conclusions when not enough "further issues" are raised.
5.  **Formal Definitions for Views (Propositional Reasoning):**
    *   **Issues/Questions:** Fundamentally represented as **sets of alternative states**.
    *   **States:** Finite sets of **atoms** (atomic verifiers `p` and their corresponding atomic falsifiers `p̅`). Unlike possible worlds, states can be inconsistent (e.g., `{p, p̅}`) and are not fully specific, allowing for distinctions between logically equivalent but cognitively non-identical contents. The empty set (`0`) represents a "tabula rasa" state.
    *   **Primitive Absurd States (𝕂):** A distinguished subset of states (e.g., `{p, p̅}`) that are transparently recognizable as absurd.
    *   **Views (V):** Defined as ordered pairs `⟨Γ, Θ⟩`, where `Γ` is the main set of alternative states (the "question") and `Θ` is the set of states representing the **supposition**. `T` (`{0}{0}`) represents truth, and `⊥` (`∅{0}`) represents contradiction.
    *   **Commitments (C):** Represented as a pair `⟨C, G⟩`, where `C` is a set of cognitively available views (premises, background knowledge) and `G` is the currently focused view.
    *   Simplified notation is introduced for examples (e.g., `{M, J}` instead of `{{M}, {J}}`).

### Section 7

This section, Part 7 of Koralus's 'Reason and Inquiry', significantly advances the formal 'view calculus' for propositional reasoning, introducing key operations that underpin the Erotetic Theory's explanation of human inference, both successful and fallacious.

Here are the key points and themes:

1.  **Formal Interpretation and Articulation:**
    *   **Interpretation Function (`o`):** Defines a recursive method to translate propositional logic formulas (`L_S`) into views (`𝕍`), primarily operating on the main set of alternative states (`Γ`) without complex suppositions for now. Conjunction (`∧`) maps to `Product (⊗)` of state sets, and disjunction (`∨`) maps to `Union (∪)` of state sets.
    *   **Articulation Procedure (`*`):** Provides a way to translate views back into propositional logic sentences, though acknowledging that views, as contents, are not linearly ordered like linguistic expressions, allowing for multiple logically equivalent outputs.

2.  **Core Operations for Updating Views (Conjunction & Disjunction):**
    *   **Product of Views (`⊗`):** A complex operation that roughly corresponds to conjunction. It combines states from two views, considering the supposition of the right-hand view (`Ψ`) to determine which states from the left-hand view (`Γ`) are involved. When suppositions are trivial, it's commutative.
    *   **Sum of Views (`⊕`):** Corresponds to disjunction, merging the alternative states of two views (`Γ ∪ Δ`) while preserving their shared supposition. Koralus emphasizes that disjunctions are inherently **inquisitive**, raising issues (sets of alternative states).
    *   **Informal Interpretation Rules:** Simple "and" maps to `Product`, and "or" maps to `Sum`, highlighting the direct connection between natural language connectives and view operations.

3.  **Explaining Illusory Inferences and Answer-Seeking:**
    *   **Atomic Answer Potential (`A^{AP}`):** A crucial graded notion defined as the number of common atoms between the union of states in two views. It quantifies the "support" one view offers to another, reflecting how reasoners find partial support.
    *   **Answer Operation:** Formalizes the Erotetic Theory's core principle that reason aims to answer issues. When a view (`Γ`) is "Answer-updated" with another view (`Δ`), only those alternatives in `Γ` that have *maximal atomic answer potential* with `Δ` are retained. This effectively reduces the "questionyness" of `Γ` by selecting alternatives most strongly supported by `Δ`.
    *   **Update Operation (`ᶜ`):** Defined as a sequence of `Answer` followed by `Merge`. This constitutes the primary mechanism for incorporating new premises into existing views.
    *   **Illusory Inferences Revisited:** The `Answer` operation directly explains the "illusory inference from disjunction." The theory shows how the order of premises matters, as reversing them can block the fallacious conclusion due to how `Answer` selects alternatives.
    *   **Disjunctive Syllogism:** The theory aims to also correctly derive valid inferences, setting the stage for `Factor` to achieve this.

4.  **Negating and Factoring Views:**
    *   **Negation of Views (`ⁿ`):** Defined as conjoining the view's supposition with the negation of its main set of alternative states (e.g., "Θ and not-Γ"). Koralus notes that computing the negation of a conjunction is computationally more costly than a disjunction, consistent with empirical findings.
    *   **Factor Operation (`ᶠ`):** This two-part operation reduces complexity in views:
        *   **Part 1 (Eliminating Absurdities):** Removes states that are primitively absurd (e.g., `{p, p̅}`). This reflects reasoners' ability to recognize and discard contradictions, though not automatically.
        *   **Part 2 (Division):** Uses a `Division` operation to remove an issue (`Δ`) that is "wholly contained" within another view (`Γ`). This allows for the derivation of "reduced" canonical conclusions (e.g., from "Q and J but not A" to simply "Q and J"), reflecting the cognitive aim to simplify issues.

5.  **Reasoning with Suppositions:**
    *   **Suppose Operation (`ˢ`):** Formalizes the strategic use of suppositional reasoning, where a view is updated to incorporate a temporary assumption, affecting both its main alternatives and its supposition.
    *   **Depose Operation (`ᴰ`):** The "return ticket" for suppositions. It undoes a supposition, integrating the conclusions derived under the assumption back into a view with a trivial supposition.
    *   **Strategic Advantage:** Suppositional reasoning is shown to strategically simplify complex problems by temporarily narrowing the scope of inquiry, making inferences more manageable.

6.  **Ex Falso Quodlibet:** The theory addresses the classical principle that anything can be derived from a contradiction. Koralus explains that while logically valid, this inference is "naively repugnant" because it goes directly against the erotetic aim of reducing the issue set and moving towards answers.

### Section 8

Part 8 significantly advances the Erotetic Theory of Reason by introducing mechanisms for strategic inquiry and formally defining different standards of rational inference.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Inquire (I) and Query (Q) Operations:**
    *   **Inquire (`I`):** Formalizes the ability to raise "polar questions" (yes/no issues) on any propositional atom without making factual assumptions. This operation is effortful, as it tends to multiply alternatives, but is crucial for making tacit alternatives explicit.
        *   It explains how **repugnant validities** (e.g., inferring "A or B" from "A") can be derived, even if counterintuitive, by explicitly raising the possibility of 'B'.
        *   Crucially, `Inquire` can **block illusory inferences** by forcing consideration of alternatives that would otherwise be neglected, demonstrating that the `Answer` procedure itself is not inherently fallacious.
        *   Systematic use of `Inquire` allows for the characterization of classical reasoning.
    *   **Query (`Q`):** An operation used to determine if a suppositional conclusion follows from a view. It checks if alternatives in the conclusion are sufficiently "contained" within the premise view given the supposition. It can lead to fallacies if not enough `Inquire` has been applied to fully explore alternatives.

2.  **Default Inference Procedure and Core Definitions:**
    *   Koralus outlines a **Default Inference Procedure** that combines the various view operations (Product, Sum, Factor, Answer, Merge, Inquire, Query) to model how reasoners process sequences of premises for "what follows?" or "does X follow?" tasks.
    *   **Commit (Def 2.27)** and **Reorient (Def 2.28)** operations are introduced to manage the reasoner's stock of accepted views and their current focus.
    *   **Inference (Def 2.29)** is formally defined as a finite sequence of these inference steps within an erotetic state.

3.  **Erotetic Equilibrium – The Standard for Correct Reasoning:**
    *   **Erotetic Equilibrium of a View (Def 2.30):** A view `G` is in equilibrium with respect to a set of views `Σ` if inquiring on any view `D` in `Σ` makes no difference to `G`. This signifies that all relevant questions have been considered.
    *   **Absolute Erotetic Equilibrium of an Inference (Def 2.32):** An inference is in absolute equilibrium if there exists an alternative, "manifest" inference where, for every application of the `Answer` operation, the views involved are in erotetic equilibrium with respect to the atoms in the answer.
    *   **Guaranteed Classical Validity:** A major achievement: Absolute Erotetic Equilibrium *guarantees classical soundness and completeness* for propositional reasoning (Theorems 2.1 & 2.2), linking the Erotetic Theory directly to classical logic under ideal conditions. This reflects a "Socratic" ideal of rationality where conclusions withstand "hostile questioning."

4.  **Restricted Erotetic Equilibrium – Explaining Everyday Rationality:**
    *   Koralus argues that absolute equilibrium is too demanding for *all* human reasoning, as people often make rational inferences without considering every possible alternative.
    *   **Topic of Inquiry (TI) (Def 2.33):** Introduced as a set of states circumscribing what is at issue in a specific inquiry.
    *   **Restricted Erotetic Equilibrium (Def 2.34):** An inference is in restricted equilibrium if, for every `Answer` step, only those alternatives within the views that fit the defined `Topic of Inquiry` need to be in erotetic equilibrium.
    *   **Explaining Rational Fallacies:** This concept explains cases like the "tiger inference" (e.g., seeing orange fur and concluding "tiger" when being hunted) where a classically invalid inference is deemed perfectly rational *given the context* and the specific topic of inquiry (e.g., "tiger cases"). It doesn't assume the conclusion, but means the reasoner isn't "on the hook" for considering alternatives outside the topic, unless directly forced.

5.  **Norms of Rationality:**
    *   **Equilibrium Requirement (Def 2.35):** If a judgment isn't in restricted equilibrium for a `TI` a reasonable person would adopt, the reasoner is not fully rational.
    *   **Equilibrium Guarantee (Def 2.36):** The more controversial claim that if a judgment *is* in restricted equilibrium for a `TI` a reasonable person would adopt, the reasoner *is* fully rational. This would require an account of what constitutes a "reasonable topic of inquiry."
    *   The theory emphasizes that for realistic rational norms, **restricted erotetic equilibrium** is more plausible than absolute equilibrium, allowing for different standards of rationality based on the context and purpose of the inquiry.

### Section 9

Part 9 of Koralus's 'Reason and Inquiry' builds on previous sections by first demonstrating how the Erotetic Theory addresses long-standing rational norms, and then transitioning to a detailed erotetic account of conditional reasoning, particularly in the context of Wason's selection tasks.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Erotetic Theory and Rational Norms:** Koralus shows how several proposed rational constraints (e.g., Priority, Excessive Demands, Logical Obtuseness, Strict Consequence, Explosion, Absurdity) are naturally satisfied by an erotetic reasoner. For instance, the theory explains why we aren't required to believe all consequences of our beliefs (Excessive Demands) because many require raising further questions that may not be "worth raising." It also explains the "explosion" from contradiction as not rationally required because nothing compels raising the specific question that would trigger it.

2.  **Introducing Conditionals ("If... Then"):** The section pivots to analyzing "if... then" statements, acknowledging their significance, especially in Wason's card selection task. Koralus aims for a general, principled approach that treats reasoning "mistakes" as integral to understanding general reasoning capacity.

3.  **Erotetic Suppositional Interpretation of "If A then C":**
    *   **Core Rule:** The linguistic meaning of "if A then C" instructs the reasoner to `Suppose` the antecedent (A) and `Update` with the consequent (C), provided A is an **acceptable supposition**. This links conditionals to Ramsey's view of hypothetical reasoning.
    *   **Modus Ponens & Fallacies:** This framework naturally explains the ease of Modus Ponens. Crucially, it attributes fallacious inferences like **Affirming the Consequent** and **Illusory Conditional Inferences** to a lack of `Inquire` operations (i.e., not being in erotetic equilibrium), rather than inherent flaw in `Answer`.
    *   **Access to Classical Alternatives:** While default reasoning can lead to fallacies, the theory explains how reasoners can, with "non-default effort" (via `Inquire`), access all possibilities consistent with material implication, aligning with empirical findings.

4.  **Supposition and Presupposition in Conditionals:**
    *   **Weak Epistemically Possible Supposition Principle:** An indicative supposition is unacceptable if it's transparently ruled out by the current state of inference. This is crucial for distinguishing indicative from subjunctive/counterfactual reasoning.
    *   **Blocking Material Antecedent Inferences:** This principle explains why inferences like "Bob didn't dance. *Therefore, if Bob danced then Zuckerberg was President" are blocked, as supposing "Bob danced" violates the acceptability principle, leading to presupposition failure.
    *   **Reconciling Data:** The theory explains why reasoners can list full truth-table possibilities (when explicitly asked, implying `Inquire`) but often omit false-antecedent cases in evaluation (where `Suppose` encounters presupposition failure).

5.  **Disequilibrium Implication (Alternative Interpretation):** Koralus introduces an alternative interpretation for some "if... then" statements, called **disequilibrium implication**, which supports inferences (e.g., Modus Ponens) only when not making erotetic equilibrium inferences (i.e., without extensive prior inquiry). This approach, though truth-conditionally vacuous, highlights how inferential power can exist outside full equilibrium. It also addresses **antecedent strengthening** by linking it to the `Topic of Inquiry` and restricted equilibrium.

6.  **Selection Tasks and Information Seeking:** Koralus proposes that Wason's card selection task errors stem from the general difficulty of contradiction detection and general problem-solving strategies, not unique mechanisms. The **Default Procedure for Information Source Selection** suggests reasoners prioritize information sources that yield novel conclusions and move towards resolving an issue with the fewest alternatives.

### Section 10

This section of Koralus's 'Reason and Inquiry' extends the Erotetic Theory's analysis of conditional reasoning, explaining a wide range of empirical findings and setting the stage for predicate logic.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Wason Selection Tasks:** The theory explains both the difficulty of the original Wason task and the improved performance in Evans's negated consequent version. The `Default Selection Procedure` makes `contradiction detection` easier in the negated consequent case (e.g., "If E then not 4") because the falsifying card (a "4") directly creates a `primitive absurdity` when updated with the conditional, unlike in the original task where more complex `Inquire` operations are needed.
2.  **Realistic Content and Background Questions:** Improved performance in "realistic" selection tasks (e.g., underage drinking scenarios) is attributed not to special deontic reasoning, but to `background questions` (e.g., "who is underage?") becoming salient in the reasoner's `Topic of Inquiry`. These questions, incorporated into the view, aid `contradiction detection` and lead to correct card selection, demonstrating domain-general principles.
3.  **Order Effects in Modus Tollens:** The Erotetic Theory accounts for why Modus Tollens (e.g., "If P then Q, Not Q, Therefore Not P") is susceptible to premise order effects, unlike Modus Ponens. It explains that Modus Tollens often requires `background information` to be fully recruited into the reasoner's view for the premises to interact and yield a conclusion, which may not happen automatically with default procedures.
4.  **"Only if" Conditionals:** "P only if Q" is analyzed as an inference rule, effectively meaning "if not Q, then not P" (`[[ψ]]^N]^S ⊗ [[φ]]^N`). This interpretation significantly simplifies Modus Tollens inferences, making them "extremely easy" and robust to premise order effects, by allowing direct `Update` with `Not Q` to yield `Not P`.
5.  **Biconditionals ("If and only if"):** The analysis of "P if and only if Q" (`[[φ]]^S ⊗ [[ψ]]^S ⊗ [[φ]]^N]]^S ⊗ [[ψ]]^N`) makes both Modus Ponens and Modus Tollens trivial. The theory also addresses `illusory consistency judgments`, explaining that the difficulty arises when reasoners don't treat `antonymy` (e.g., "unsaleable") as equivalent to `negation` (e.g., "not saleable"), increasing `erotetic complexity`.
6.  **Denying the Antecedent (DA) Fallacy:** The theory explains DA inferences (e.g., "If P then Q, Not P, Therefore Not Q") by appealing to `identificational focus`. A focused interpretation like "IF P then Q" can be paraphrased as "Only if P, then Q" (or "if not P, then not Q"), which, when processed through the "only if" rule, directly yields `Not Q`. This more complex process explains why DA is less frequent and slower than Affirming the Consequent.
7.  **Possibility Talk and Fallacies:** A preliminary rule for "it is possible that P" is introduced as `{P,0}`. This framework explains common fallacies such as endorsing "possible P and possible Q" to "possible (P and Q)" and `impossibility fallacies` (e.g., inferring that something is not possible from a conditional and a disjunction) by showing how the `Query` operation interacts with these representations in a default reasoning context.
8.  **Transition to Predicate Reasoning:** The section concludes by introducing the extension of the erotetic theory to `predicates and relations` (Chapter 4). It proposes that indefinite statements like "somebody smokes" function similarly to disjunctions, raising questions about which individual satisfies the predicate. This extension maintains classical soundness and completeness under erotetic equilibrium.
9.  **Indefinite Illusory Inferences:** The theory predicts and finds empirical support for "indefinite illusory inferences" (e.g., "Some A's are B; X is an A; Therefore X is B"), paralleling previously discussed disjunctive fallacies. This explains phenomena like the "Politician's Syllogism" as a natural consequence of default reasoning in the erotetic framework.

### Section 11

This section, Part 11, formally extends the Erotetic Theory to **predicate reasoning** and quantifiers ("some," "all"), aiming to resolve the "Cardinality Problem" (how finite minds represent infinite content) while accounting for diverse empirical findings.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Revisiting Indefinite Inferences ("Some"):**
    *   The `indefinite illusory inference` (e.g., "Some A's are B; X is an A; Therefore X is B") is a result of the question-answering process.
    *   **Order Effects:** Reversing the order of premises significantly reduces these fallacies, supporting the idea that the "question" (what individual satisfies "some") needs to be established before an "answer" is sought.
    *   This generalizes to disjunctive contexts, with similar illusory inferences when "some" expands into questions based on infinitary disjunctions.

2.  **Explaining Diverse Quantified Reasoning Phenomena:**
    *   **"Married People Puzzle" (Example 50):** Errors in intuitively difficult but logically simple problems like this are attributed to reasoners failing to fully take on board all relevant issues (e.g., Sally's marital status) before making a `Query`.
    *   **Easy Valid Inferences:** Basic `Quantified Modus Ponens` (Example 51) is correctly solved by most, demonstrating fundamental competence.
    *   **Quantified Fallacies:** Reasoners are prone to `Affirming the Consequent` (or "Conversion Fallacy" – Examples 52, 53) in quantified contexts (e.g., inferring "All B are A" from "All A are B").
    *   **Generic Statements (Example 54):** The puzzling inferential behavior of generics (e.g., "Sharks attack bathers" implies "Whitey attacks bathers," based on little evidence but robust to counter-evidence) is introduced as a challenge, with `restricted erotetic equilibrium` hinted as a solution.
    *   **Complex Dependencies:** Some complex multi-quantifier inferences are intuitively obvious (Example 56), while others with minor structural differences yield widely varied performance (Examples 57 vs. 58), attributed to how premises determine the dynamics of variable instantiation.

3.  **Solving the Cardinality Problem with Arbitrary Objects:**
    *   **The Problem:** Mental representations must be finite, yet quantifiers represent potentially infinite sets of individuals. Standard predicate logic formulas are finite but may not accurately mirror the structure of content (e.g., quantifier order invariance). Existing mental model theory approaches are critiqued for not providing a clear, content-preserving, and operationally defined solution.
    *   **The Solution: Arbitrary Objects:** Koralus adopts Kit Fine's concept of **arbitrary objects**. These are non-individual entities that possess only the properties common to the individuals in their range (e.g., an "arbitrary dog" for "all dogs bark"). This allows for finite mental models that directly correspond to the structure of the content being represented, without invoking infinite sets or abstract "footnotes."

4.  **Formalizing Predicate Views:**
    *   **Basic Objects:** Introduction of arbitrary objects (A), functions (F), predicates (P^T) and their falsifier counterparts (P^⊥), and a special `?` for issues.
    *   **Terms, Atoms, States:** These are defined using the new basic objects, extending the propositional view formalism.
    *   **Dependency Relations (U, E, D):** To capture quantification, arbitrary objects are categorized as `independent` (U, for universals) or `dependent` (E, for existentials). `Dependencies (D)` form a bipartite graph, with `E` depending on `U`.
    *   **The Matryoshka Condition:** A crucial constraint on dependency relations, ensuring they are well-formed and can be uniquely and consistently represented, analogous to prenex-normal form in classical predicate logic. This condition enforces a nested structure of dependencies.
    *   **Issue Structures (`[]Γ`):** Introduced as a formal way to represent "aboutness" or "focus" beyond truth-conditions. Composed of pairs of terms and `open atoms` (containing `?`), these structures guide default `instantiation inferences`, explaining why an inference like "All dogs bark. Fido is a dog. Therefore Fido barks" is automatic.

In essence, this section lays the formal and conceptual groundwork for incorporating quantifiers and predicate logic into the Erotetic Theory through the innovative use of arbitrary objects, structured dependencies, and issue-driven reasoning.

### Section 12

This section formally extends the Erotetic Theory to predicate reasoning and quantifiers, building upon the arbitrary objects introduced previously. It establishes the foundational definitions, notational conventions, and operational rules required for this expansion.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Formalizing Predicate Views:**
    *   **Views (𝒱):** A predicate view is formally defined as a quadruple `⟨Γ, Θ, R, I⟩`, comprising a main set of states (Γ), a supposition set of states (Θ), a dependency relation (R), and an issue structure (I). This structure integrates the new elements for handling quantification.
    *   **Notational Conventions:** Simplified notation is introduced for arbitrary objects (independent/universal `x`, dependent/existential `a`, non-arbitrary individuals `j`), issue structures (using `^`), and dependency relations (using `→`).
    *   **Informal Interpretation Rules:** Heuristics are provided for interpreting "all" and "some" quantifiers into views and for assigning issue structures (focus) based on quantifier restrictors or main noun phrases in natural language sentences.

2.  **Expanding Primitive Absurdities (𝕂) and Analyticity:**
    *   **Predicate Absurdities:** The set of `primitive absurd states (𝕂)` is extended beyond propositional contradictions to include `non-identity ({≠tt})` and `Leibniz's Law ({= tt', x[t/?], x̅[t'/?]})`.
    *   **Encoding Axioms:** The theory proposes that any first-order axiomatizable subject (e.g., arithmetic, set theory, spatial reasoning) can be integrated by reframing its axioms as `absurdity clauses` within `𝕂` (i.e., specifying what is ruled out), rather than as explicit commitments. This avoids introducing new reasoning operations.
    *   **Erotetic Analytic-Synthetic Distinction:** Inferences that directly arise from `𝕂` (merely by raising a question, ruling out absurd alternatives) are termed `erotetic-analytic`, akin to conceptual truths. Inferences requiring further premise-like facts or reasoning steps are `erotetic-synthetic`.

3.  **Duality between Views and Predicate Calculus (𝓛_PC):**
    *   **Interpretation (`°`):** Formal procedures are defined to translate sentences of `𝓛_PC` (especially those in Prenex Normal Form) into Erotetic Theory views, by interpreting quantifier-free formulas as sets of states and quantifiers as modifications to dependency relations.
    *   **Articulation (`*`):** Inverse procedures are defined to translate views back into `𝓛_PC` sentences.
    *   **Duality Theorem (4.2):** This establishes that these `°` and `*` mappings are logically equivalent inverses, ensuring the formal correspondence between the Erotetic Theory's predicate views and classical predicate logic.

4.  **Updated View Algebra (Merge and Restriction):**
    *   **Restriction Operations:** New operations (`ℛ Restriction`, `𝕀 Restriction`) are introduced to prune dependency relations and issue structures when arbitrary objects or atoms are removed from a view, maintaining well-formedness.
    *   **Fusion of Dependency Relations (⋈):** A crucial recursive operation `⋈` (fusion) is defined to combine the dependency relations of two views (e.g., during conjunction/Product). It intelligently integrates universal and existential arbitrary objects and their dependencies while avoiding unwanted dependencies that simple `chaining (⋊)` would generate.
    *   **Updated Operations:** The core reasoning operations like `Product` and `Sum` are redefined to incorporate these new elements (dependency relations and issue structures) and their respective restriction and fusion mechanisms.

### Section 13

Part 13 of 'Reason and Inquiry' details the formal extension of the Erotetic Theory's core reasoning operations to incorporate predicate logic, quantifiers, arbitrary objects, and dependency relations. It systematically redefines and updates key algebraic and reasoning operations, ensuring they can handle the complexities introduced by quantification while maintaining soundness.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Refined Core Operations for Predicate Logic:**
    *   **Sum (`⊕`):** Updated to use the `Fusion (⋈)` operation for intelligently combining complex dependency relations between arbitrary objects.
    *   **Answer (4.30):** Largely unchanged, but now includes `Restriction` on dependency (`R`) and issue (`I`) structures if relevant states are eliminated.
    *   **Negation (4.31):** Extends beyond propositional negation by "flipping" the dependency relation (`[R]^N`) and adding falsifier counterparts to the issue structure (`[I]^N`), formally capturing the negation of quantified statements (e.g., negating "everybody loves somebody" yields "some person does not love anybody").
    *   **Substitution (4.32, informal):** An essential component operation that replaces arbitrary objects with terms. Crucially, it introduces "novelization" (replacing arbitrary objects with fresh ones) for lower-level or same-level existential arbitrary objects to prevent illegitimate variable capture and updates dependency relations and issue structures accordingly.
    *   **Merge (4.33):** Updated to perform "instantiation" of arbitrary objects that are issue-matched with terms in the internal argument *before* forming the `Product`. This relies on `Substitution` and prevents unsound name collisions, as illustrated by inferences involving disjunctions and conditionals.

2.  **The Updated `Update` Procedure and Instantiation Operations (4.7):**
    *   **Update (4.34):** The central default reasoning procedure is now formally decomposed into a sequence of four operations: `Universal Product (U)`, `Existential Sum (E)`, `Answer (A)`, and `Merge (M)`. The arbitrary objects in the internal argument (`D`) are always "novelized" to prevent unintended scope issues across multiple premises.
    *   **Universal Product (`U`, 4.35):** Performs simultaneous universal instantiation, generating conjunctions of possibilities. It is guided by issue matches between the external and internal arguments and operates under specific constraints regarding suppositions and shared arbitrary objects. It can instantiate arbitrary objects with other arbitrary objects.
    *   **Reorient (4.36):** Allows the reasoner to change the focus of inquiry (issue structure) or the subject of reasoning (to any view in the commitment set), granting flexibility akin to using universal instantiation creatively in classical logic.
    *   **Existential Sum (`E`, 4.37):** Analogous to existential instantiation, it generates disjuncts by creating copies of the external argument for each appropriate issue match, substituting relevant existentials, and adding the result as a disjunct (while preserving the original argument for soundness). This complex operation ensures accurate handling of existential claims, as demonstrated in various examples resolving order effects.

3.  **Revised Division and Factor Operations (4.8):**
    *   **Division (4.38):** Maintained from Chapter 2, with the addition of `Restriction` operations on `R` and `I` if elements are eliminated.
    *   **Factor (4.39):** Expanded to utilize the updated set of `primitive absurd states (𝕂)`, enabling more inferences by factoring out contradictions. Critically, it now allows "factoring out generalizations from specifics" by instantiating universals based on issue matches, aiming to "compress" particular facts into known general ones, potentially reducing cognitive complexity.

4.  **Complex Query for Existential Generalization (4.9):**
    *   **Query (4.41):** Significantly updated to perform "existential generalization," especially when novel existential arbitrary objects are introduced.
    *   It relies on a complex **`Φ` test** that checks if a state from the internal argument can be contained in an external argument state after a sequence of substitutions of existential arbitrary objects, guided by issue matches.
    *   The most intricate aspect is the construction of `D_S'` – a multi-layered mechanism for combining and adding dependencies to the resulting view. This includes preserving original dependencies, adding extra dependencies for multiple terms substituted with the same existential (making them dependent on *all* universals to prevent "spurious identities"), and handling dependencies arising from complex terms or Matryoshka level orderings (Definition 4.40). These safeguards are crucial for ensuring the classical validity and soundness of existential generalizations.

In summary, Part 13 lays out the rigorous formal framework for quantifier reasoning within the Erotetic Theory. It demonstrates how arbitrary objects, dependency relations, and issue structures are intricately integrated into the theory's operations to explain diverse phenomena in quantified reasoning, including common fallacies and valid inferences, while solving the cardinality problem and ensuring logical soundness through mechanisms like novelization and precise dependency management.

### Section 14

Part 14 extends the Erotetic Theory's predicate reasoning framework by detailing the application of the updated operations and introducing the concept of generics, which are explained through the distinction between absolute and restricted erotetic equilibrium.

Here are the key points, themes, and important details:

1.  **Illustrations of `Query` (Existential Generalization):**
    *   The section provides examples of the `Query` operation (4.41), demonstrating its precision in handling existential generalization and dependency relations. It shows how "everybody teaches either John or Mary, both of whom are students" validly leads to "everybody teaches some student" (where 'some student' depends on 'everybody'), but *not* to "there is a student whom everybody teaches" (where 'some student' would not depend on 'everybody'), accurately reflecting classical logic's scope distinctions.
    *   The complex `Φ` test and `D_S'` dependency construction (from Part 13) are highlighted as crucial for ensuring soundness by preventing illegitimate variable capture and managing dependencies correctly.
    *   It reinforces that existential generalization, despite "throwing away information," is intuitively more acceptable than disjunction introduction because it can *reduce* the "question load" in the erotetic framework, making the mental model "less inquisitive."

2.  **Refinement of `Inquire`, `Suppose`, `Depose`, and `Commit`:**
    *   **`Wh-Query` (4.42):** A new operation is introduced for making "who," "what," or "which" queries, extending the theory's interrogative capabilities.
    *   **`Inquire` (4.43):** This operation is updated to handle predicate logic, distinguishing between cases where arbitrary objects (AOs) overlap or not. It uses "novelization" for non-overlapping AOs to create `P or not-P` polar questions and is shown to enable identity inferences by leveraging the expanded set of primitive absurd states (`𝕂`) which includes identity axioms. This allows resolving the "married people puzzle" by inquiring about Sally's marital status.
    *   **`Suppose` (4.44) and `Depose` (4.45):** These are also updated to manage AOs and their dependencies, particularly employing "novelization" when supposing an argument with non-overlapping AOs to prevent variable clashes.
    *   **`Commit` (4.46):** This operation simply adds the current view to the commitment set.

3.  **Updated Definition of `Inference` and `Erotetic Equilibrium`:**
    *   **`Inference` (4.47):** The formal definition of an inference is updated to reflect the new set of operations and to acknowledge that conclusions are considered identical "up to uniform replacement of A objects" due to the novelization steps inherent in many operations.
    *   **Default Reasoning Procedure:** The core procedure remains largely unchanged but now specifically enforces the "novelty constraint" for arbitrary objects upon their introduction.
    *   **`Absolute Erotetic Equilibrium` (4.50):** This crucial concept, along with Theorem 4.3 (Classical Soundness and Completeness), is reiterated. It guarantees that if an inference is in absolute erotetic equilibrium, its articulated predicate calculus counterpart is classically sound. Conversely, classical derivability implies erotetic derivability under absolute equilibrium. This establishes the Erotetic Theory's formal correspondence and normative adequacy for classical reasoning.

4.  **Generics and `Restricted Erotetic Equilibrium` (4.12):**
    *   **The Puzzle of Generics:** The section introduces generics (e.g., "sharks attack bathers") as a prevalent but problematic form of generalization. They are characterized by a slim evidence base (especially for "striking properties"), stable coexistence with counterinstances, and strong inferential power (like universals). Standard logical approaches struggle with their indeterminate content.
    *   **Erotetic Solution for Generics:**
        *   **Formalization:** Generics are treated as "logically vacuous" by including `0` (an alternative compatible with everything) in their main set of states (e.g., `⟦ Sharks attack bathers ⟧ = {SxAx, 0}{Sx}`). This explains why no counterinstances can conclusively contradict them.
        *   **Inferential Power:** Despite being vacuous, generics still enable inferences to particulars (e.g., from "sharks attack bathers" to "this shark attacks bathers") within the erotetic framework, without needing new inference rules, relying on arbitrary objects and the default reasoning procedure.
        *   **Dual Role: Rationality vs. Scientific Discourse:**
            *   **Unsuitable for Science:** Because generics are logically vacuous, they cannot yield sound conclusions under *absolute* erotetic equilibrium. This explains why they are inappropriate for rigorous scientific discourse, which demands valid inferences from generalizations.
            *   **Rational Permissibility:** However, generics can be *rationally permissible* under *restricted* erotetic equilibrium (4.52). By defining a "topic of inquiry" (TI) (e.g., focusing on "things that are dangerous"), an inference from a generic (e.g., "sharks attack bathers") to a particular conclusion (e.g., "this shark is dangerous") can be justified within that restricted context.
        *   **"Externalities of Reason":** The theory highlights that while restricted inquiry can be efficient and rational in everyday contexts (like avoiding a dangerous pool), it can also lead to "externalities of reason." This explains why some generics, particularly stereotypes, can be unfair or ethically problematic, as the restricted topic of inquiry might be illegitimate, requiring "serious consideration of both the possibility of bearing and not bearing those properties."

In essence, Part 14 concludes the formal predicate logic extension of the Erotetic Theory, demonstrating its power to model complex inferences, explain common fallacies, ensure classical soundness/completeness, and provide a novel, nuanced account of generics by distinguishing between absolute and context-dependent (restricted) standards of rational inquiry.

### Section 15

Part 15 transitions from the discussion of generics to introduce the Erotetic Theory's extension to **reasoning with graded uncertainty (probability)**.

**Key Points:**

*   **Generics and Conditionals:** The section briefly connects the previous discussion of generics to "matchbox conditionals" (e.g., "if the match is struck, it will light"), suggesting that belief in such conditionals stems from believing a generic ("struck matches light") and a particular. Like generics, these conditionals often generate conclusions only under a restricted topic of inquiry.
*   **Introduction to Reasoning with Uncertainty:** The chapter begins to formally address human reasoning about uncertain events, aiming to explain both systematic failures and successes in probabilistic judgment.
*   **Success Criterion: Bayes's Rule:** It introduces the probability calculus and Bayes's Rule (Definitions 5.1, 5.2) as the normative standard for coherent probabilistic reasoning, emphasizing its role in updating beliefs given evidence.
*   **Systematic Failures in Probabilistic Reasoning:** The text highlights several well-documented cognitive biases and fallacies:
    *   **Base-rate neglect (Examples 64, 65):** People often ignore prior probabilities (base rates) when given specific evidence, leading to incorrect estimations (e.g., disease probability given a positive test).
    *   **Frequency vs. Probability Formats (Example 66):** Presenting problems in terms of natural frequencies (e.g., "1 out of 100") significantly improves performance compared to percentages/probabilities, suggesting a cognitive bias.
    *   **Inviting Inferences (Examples 67, 68):** Media and anecdotes often invite tempting but unsupported probabilistic inferences by omitting crucial base-rate information (e.g., CEO pet ownership, Uber safety claims).
    *   **Evidence Fallacy (Example 69):** Confusing the probability of evidence given innocence (P(E|not G)) with the probability of guilt given evidence (P(G|E)).
    *   **Conjunction Incoherence/Fallacy (Examples 74, 75):** People sometimes judge a conjunction (A & B) to be more probable than one of its conjuncts (B), a violation of basic probability axioms (e.g., the "Linda Problem").
    *   **Illusory Probability Inferences (Examples 72, 73):** Similar to earlier illusory inferences, where partial information leads to misjudgments, often based on an incorrect assumption of equal likelihood among incompletely specified alternatives.
*   **Erotetic Theory's Solution: Equilibrium Answer Potential:** To integrate uncertainty into the theory, Koralus proposes that graded uncertainty is not a fundamental notion but rather emerges from "equilibrium answer potential."
    *   This means alternatives can have varying "strength" or "claim to answer" a question, even under absolute erotetic equilibrium, without being strictly entailed.
    *   **Mechanism:** Views will be augmented with "weighted states" (e.g., a state appearing multiple times to signify higher likelihood). This allows for representing varying degrees of answer potential, which can be influenced by factors like frequencies, imaginability, or propensities, and can take complex forms (including arbitrary objects and functions).

### Section 16

Part 16 introduces **extended views** to incorporate graded uncertainty, building on the Erotetic Theory's predicate logic framework. It details the formal apparatus for representing and reasoning with probabilities, showing how the theory can model both successful and fallacious probabilistic inferences.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Extended Views with Weights:**
    *   **Concept:** A "classical" view (main states, supposition, dependency, issue) is extended by adding an assignment of "weights" to each state in the main set.
    *   **Weights:** Formally defined as finite "multisets" (bags allowing repetitions) of terms. This allows states to be "multiply weighted" to represent varying answer potential or likelihood.
    *   **Conservative Extension:** Extended views are a conservative extension of classical views; classical views can be seen as extended views where all states have empty weights. Updated reasoning operations also retain this conservativeness.
    *   **Weight Arithmetic:** Real numbers, multiplication (`x̅`), and summation (`σ`) are added to the set of terms to support arithmetic operations on weights.

2.  **Updated Operations for Extended Views:**
    *   **`E Answer potential` (EAP):** A new concept that quantifies the "claim to answer" a question based on the accumulated weights of states. `Δ_g[Γ]^EP` calculates this potential by summing weights of states in `Δ` that contain alternatives in `Γ`. The theory idealizes that complex weight arithmetic (e.g., `σ(⟪σ⟪30⟫, σ⟪70⟫) = 100`) is resolved in the background.
    *   **`Answer` (Updated):** The core `Answer` operation is redefined in two steps:
        1.  It first reduces alternatives in the issue (`Γ`) to those with *maximum EAP* from the answering view (`Δ`).
        2.  Then, it further reduces the result to those with *maximum Atomic Answer Potential* (the previous notion of answer potential based on atomic overlap). This new definition strictly generalizes the prior `Answer`.
    *   **`Sum` (⊕):** Defines the addition of weighted sets of states, using multiset addition for weights, which is commutative, associative, and has an empty multiset as a zero element.
    *   **`Product` (⊗):** Defines the product of weighted sets of states. Weight multiplication (e.g., `⟪2.s⟫ × ⟪t, 3.u⟫ = ⟪2.(s × t), 6.(s × u)⟫`) is introduced, noting its quasi-bilinearity but *failure of full bilinearity, commutativity, and associativity*.
    *   **`Negation`:** Largely unchanged; the theory simplifies by not allowing wide-scope "not" over probability talk.
    *   **`Factor`:** Eliminates primitively absurd states.
    *   **`Inquire` (Updated):** Updated to use `Product` and `Sum` operations, accommodating arbitrary objects (AOs) and their dependencies, distinguishing between overlapping and non-overlapping AOs.
    *   **`Query` (Updated):** Expanded to query about probabilities based on a given weighted view.

3.  **Modeling Graded Uncertainty and Probabilistic Inferences:**
    *   **Grounding Probability Judgments:** The theory proposes that naïve human judgments of probability are grounded in judgments about EAP.
    *   **Equiprobability Assumption:** Reasoners generally assume alternative states in a view are equiprobable, especially when no other information is available. This is *modeled as a reasoning step* (distributing `P_max` among empty-weighted alternatives via `Inquire`), not a hard-wired commitment, explaining why it can be refused. This allows the theory to secure Bayesianism with uniform priors under erotetic equilibrium.
    *   **`Default procedure for "what is the probability of Δ?" tasks`:** This key algorithm processes premises, first attempting a `Query` directly. If this doesn't yield a probability, it distributes the remaining maximum probability (`P_max`) equally among alternatives with empty weights, then re-queries.
    *   **Empirical Fit:** The default procedure is shown to successfully model various empirical data from Johnson-Laird et al. (1999) on probabilistic judgments from propositional premises. This includes cases where human responses align with "unbiased" (correct) probability and instances of "illusory" (fallacious or biased) probability inferences (e.g., giving 0 for P(A&B) when an unbiased estimate would be 25%).

4.  **Conditionals and Uncertainty:**
    *   The section outlines how "if...then" statements are combined with probability talk.
    *   **Interpretation Rule:** "There is an x% probability that H" is interpreted as `{x · γ}RI` where `γ` is the state representing H.
    *   **Examples:** The theory's procedures are applied to "easy" and "illusory" partial probability inferences (e.g., correctly deriving P(red marble) = 0.2 from given probabilities of green and blue marbles, and also deriving 0.2 for an illusory case, matching human intuition).
    *   It also shows how conditional probability statements (e.g., "If H, then there is a 90% probability that D") are interpreted within the system, setting the stage for analyzing phenomena like the evidence fallacy.

In summary, Part 16 formalizes the Erotetic Theory's capacity to handle graded uncertainty by introducing weighted extended views and updating its core operations. This framework not only integrates probabilistic reasoning but also effectively models the origins and characteristics of both normative and systematically biased human probability judgments, particularly in contexts where equiprobability is assumed by default.

### Section 17

Part 17 further refines the Erotetic Theory's framework for graded uncertainty, focusing on conditional probabilities, base-rate neglect, and, crucially, the **conjunction fallacy**, which necessitates incorporating memory search and background knowledge.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Conditional Probability and EAP:** The theory demonstrates that views derived from conditional probability statements (e.g., "If H, then there is a 0.9 probability that D") accurately encode the conditional probability ratio (P(H ∩ D)) / P(H) via their Equilibrium Answer Potential (EAP) functions. This ensures consistency with Bayesian principles under ideal conditions. It also shows how the theory aligns with empirical observations linking "if...then" statements to conditional probabilities.

2.  **Updated Operations for Extended Views:**
    *   **`Suppose` (Definition 5.22) and `Depose` (Definition 5.23):** Remain largely the same, but `Suppose` is restricted to "propositional" suppositions without substantive EAPs.
    *   **`Multiproduct` (Definition 5.24) and `Substitution` (Definition 5.25):** Updated from Chapter 4 to handle weighted, extended views and arbitrary objects consistently.
    *   **`Merge` (Definition 5.26):** Redefined using the updated `Multiproduct`.
    *   **`Universal Product` (Definition 5.28):** Updated for extended views, crucial for interpreting statements like "if someone Φs, the probability is X% that they Ψ" universally, often by implicitly attributing a statistical theory to reasoners.

3.  **Modeling Fallacies and Biases:**
    *   **Evidence Fallacy / Invited Inferences (Example 67, 69):** The default reasoning procedure can generate spurious high probability conclusions (e.g., high probability of guilt from conditional evidence alone, or high conditional probability of being a CEO given pet ownership) by prioritizing direct evidence and defaulting to maximum EAP, even when base-rate information is lacking or ignored.
    *   **Base-Rate Neglect (Examples 64, 65):**
        *   The theory models this by treating base-rate information as "completely orthogonal" or by prioritizing premises directly relevant to the specific case, leading to overestimation (e.g., high probability of disease given a positive test despite low base rate).
        *   It can generate a 15% estimate for colorectal cancer (still high, but closer than 50% often observed) by combining probabilities.
        *   **Frequency Formats (Example 66):** The theory suggests that presenting problems in "natural frequencies" (e.g., "1 out of 100") allows for a more tractable regimentation where the default procedure yields the correct answer by directly translating into states with specific weights.

4.  **Conjunction Fallacy (Examples 74, 75):** This is a major focus, requiring a new mechanism: **Memory Search for Background Knowledge.**
    *   **The Problem:** The default procedure alone cannot explain conjunction fallacies, as premises might not directly overlap.
    *   **Linkage Potential (Definition 5.29, 5.30):** When premises lack atomic overlap, the theory postulates that reasoners consult background knowledge. This search for relevant information operates by abstracting away argument terms, using "free atoms" (Definition 5.29) to find potential "linkage views" (Definition 5.30) whose supposition connects to one premise and whose main set connects to another.
    *   **Mechanism:** Background commitments (e.g., generics like "guns whose triggers are pulled fire") are recruited. When these "linkage commitments" are integrated, they introduce additional EAP support for the conjunction, causing it to accumulate more weight than one of its conjuncts, thereby generating the conjunction fallacy (e.g., "Dyspnea and Hemiparesis" being judged more probable than "Hemiparesis" given pulmonary embolism).
    *   **Justification:** This process is analogous to illusory inferences in propositional reasoning. The theory argues that memory search for linkages is constrained by "narrow" commitments and few atoms, avoiding combinatorial explosion.

5.  **Remaining Operations:** The section concludes by lifting `Division` (Definition 5.31), `Factor` (Definition 5.32), `Which?` (Definition 5.33), `Existential sum` (Definition 5.34), and `Factor (identity)` (Definition 5.35) to extended views for theoretical completeness, illustrating how the entire ETR framework accommodates graded uncertainty.

In essence, Part 17 significantly extends the Erotetic Theory's ability to model human reasoning under uncertainty, explaining both successes and systematic failures like the conjunction fallacy by integrating default reasoning procedures with the dynamic recruitment of background knowledge.

### Section 18

This section, "Part 18: Bayesian Updating and Erotetic Equilibrium," explains how the Erotetic Theory integrates Bayesian probability and accounts for expert judgment and forecasting, grounding these in the theory's "naïve reasoning capacities" and erotetic equilibrium.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1.  **Bayesian Updating from Naïve Reasoning:**
    *   **Problem:** Existing theories struggle to explain how "naïve reasoners" can perform successful Bayesian updating without explicit knowledge of Bayes' theorem.
    *   **ETR's Solution:** The erotetic theory proposes that Bayesian updating is grounded in our fundamental reasoning capacities. It shows that by using the updated operations (especially `Answer Potential` and `Query`), a reasoning strategy can be defined that consistently yields correct posterior probabilities and likelihood ratios.
    *   **Derivation:** The text demonstrates how a view (G) incorporating priors (P(H), P(¬H)) and likelihoods (P(D|H), P(D|¬H)) can be processed to yield P(H|D) as (P(D|H) × P(H)) / (P(D|H) × P(H) + P(D|¬H) × P(¬H)), directly matching Bayes' theorem. Similarly, it shows how posterior likelihood ratios are derived. This demonstrates that coherent probabilistic updating is an inherent outcome of the ETR framework.

2.  **Erotetic Equilibrium and Probabilistic Coherence:**
    *   **Objective:** To show that the erotetic theory's `Answer Potential` can explain and ground the axioms of probability in "common sense" reasoning.
    *   **Challenges of Views:** Views are richer than mere truth conditions (unlike Boolean algebras of events). A "realization" operation (⟦[Δ]⟧) maps views to subsets of a sample space (Ω_G), preserving Boolean operations.
    *   **Coherent Probabilistic Judgments:** A view affords coherent probabilistic judgments if: (1) Its `Answer Potential` for a view Δ depends only on its realization ⟦Δ⟧ (i.e., G[Δ]^EP = G[[Δ]]^EP), not the specific view representation. (2) The normalized `Answer Potential` (A ↦ G[A]^EP / G[{0}]^EP) forms a coherent probability measure (satisfying P(Ω)=1 and P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B) for disjoint A, B).
    *   **Equilibrium Basis View (Definition 5.36):** A view in erotetic equilibrium with respect to all literals in its atomic structure, where all states have non-negative real number weights.
    *   **Theorem 5.3:** If a view is an equilibrium basis view, then it affords coherent probabilistic judgments. This formally links erotetic equilibrium to the possibility of coherent probability.

3.  **Expert Forecasting and Restricted Erotetic Equilibrium:**
    *   **Expert Judgment's Limitations:** Expert predictions often diverge from observed frequencies (e.g., Gigerenzer's rocket launch example where engineers' "propensity" estimates exclude human error and differ from actual frequencies).
    *   **Restricted Erotetic Equilibrium:** Koralus argues that academic expert judgment is typically a form of **restricted erotetic equilibrium**. Experts focus only on the dimensions of a problem where they possess specialized knowledge, implicitly *not raising* (i.e., ignoring for the purpose of their expert assessment) other relevant factors (e.g., human error, weather, politics) even if they acknowledge their existence. This explains why expert judgments can be incomplete or suboptimal.
    *   **Improving Judgment:** While expert judgment can be restricted, moving *closer* to absolute erotetic equilibrium (by considering a broader range of factors) can improve forecasting accuracy.
    *   **"Superforecasters" and Cognitive Policies:** Research by Tetlock and collaborators (Good Judgment Project) shows that "superforecasters" significantly outperform traditional experts, not due to greater subject knowledge, but due to specific **cognitive policies**. These policies include:
        *   **Fermi-izing:** Decomposing complex events into contingencies.
        *   **Modulated external view:** Using relevant reference classes.
        *   **Proportional update:** Adjusting predictions based on new information's impact on contingencies.
        *   **Explicit negative contingencies:** Actively identifying ways an event might fail.
        *   **Precision:** Making nuanced numerical estimates.
    *   **ETR's Interpretation:** These cognitive policies are seen as methods to bring reasoners closer to erotetic equilibrium, particularly in problems with "high inquisitive load" (many relevant contingencies). This framework suggests that in such complex domains, broad inquiry (leading to greater equilibrium) can be more effective than deep but narrow expertise.
    *   **Link to Decision-Making:** The section concludes by hinting that EAP, rather than mere probability, is fundamental because the ultimate goal is to settle questions of "what to do."

### Section 19

This section, "Decision and Practical Reasoning," extends the Erotetic Theory of Inquiry (ETR) to human decision-making, aiming to explain both its successes and systematic failures. It argues that decisions, like inferences, involve asking a question and seeking an answer, with failures often stemming from a lack of "erotetic equilibrium."

Key points include:

1.  **The Problem of Success and Failure:** Humans are capable of highly effective decision-making, yet also exhibit systematic breakdowns of control even when basic conditions (information, time, etc.) are available. The ETR focuses on failures inherent in the process of practical reasoning itself, rather than external factors.

2.  **The "Narrow Frame" Problem & Too Few Alternatives:**
    *   A prominent failure is the tendency to consider too few alternative possibilities. Studies show "whether-or-not" decisions (e.g., buy or not buy) have significantly higher failure rates and lower quality ratings than multi-alternative decisions (e.g., Nutt 1993, Gemünden & Hauschild 1985).
    *   **Opportunity Cost Neglect (Example 90):** Explicitly framing an alternative as "keep the money for other purchases" significantly changes decisions compared to a simple "not buy" option, even though objectively the situation is the same (Frederick et al. 2009). This fragility suggests a decision is not in erotetic equilibrium if merely drawing attention to known options alters the outcome.
    *   **Caveat:** Simply adding *more* alternatives isn't always beneficial; too many similar options can overwhelm decision-makers (Iyengar & Lepper 2000), and the **Decoy Effect (Example 91)** shows that a "dominated" option (one clearly inferior to another) can manipulate choices towards a more expensive alternative, without anyone actually choosing the decoy (Ariely 2008). The ETR interprets this as "jumping to conclusions" by treating a partial answer as a full one.

3.  **Framing Effects on Choice and Judgment:**
    *   **Choosing vs. Rejecting (Example 92):** In a hypothetical child custody case, Parent B, who has both more positive and more negative traits, is chosen by the majority both for *awarding* and *denying* custody (Shafir 1993). This is because decision-makers focus on reasons for choosing when awarding, and reasons for rejecting when denying, leading to inconsistent choices in objectively equivalent situations.
    *   Similar effects are observed in moral judgments about "obligatory" vs. "impermissible" acts (Koralus & Alfano 2017).
    *   The ETR argues this reflects an irrational application of *stable priorities* rather than fundamental preference changes, preserving the idea of rational control.
    *   **Asian Disease Problem (Example 93):** Framing identical outcomes in terms of "people die" vs. "people saved" significantly alters preferred treatments (Tversky & Kahneman 1981).

4.  **The Endowment Effect (Example 94):**
    *   People tend to prefer keeping an item they were randomly given over trading it for an objectively equivalent alternative (Kahneman, Knetsch, & Thaler 1990).
    *   The ETR critiques explanations based on fundamental **loss aversion**, arguing this implies intrinsic irrationality, which undermines the concept of decision-making control.
    *   **Empirical Counter-evidence:** The endowment effect is diminished or absent in "brokers" who don't own the item themselves (Morewedge et al. 2009) and, crucially, in experienced traders in real-world markets; it disappears with experience (List 2003, 2004). This suggests it's not a deeply ingrained, immutable irrationality.

5.  **Erotetic Theory of Decision-Making as a Solution:**
    *   The ETR proposes that decision-making involves: (1) raising a decision question, (2) considering views of consequences of alternatives, and (3) treating priorities as answers.
    *   Systematic failures arise from "jumping to conclusions" or accepting "illusory reasons" due to a lack of erotetic equilibrium, mirroring the explanation for fallacies in inferential reasoning.
    *   By *not* jumping to conclusions and moving towards erotetic equilibrium, decision-makers can make choices that align with classical rational choice theory.
    *   The ETR aims to bridge classical economics (viewed as studying decision-making *under erotetic equilibrium*) and behavioral economics (explaining deviations), offering a unified account where both rational success and systematic failure flow from the same fundamental principles.

### Section 20

This section, "Part 20: Practical Reasoning," extends the Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) to decision-making, presenting a dynamic, question-based account that diverges from classical rational choice theory and reframes the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) model.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1.  **Critique of Classical Decision Theory:**
    *   Classical rational decision-making is impractical: it demands considering *all* alternative actions and their complete expected consequences "all at once," leaving no room for dynamic planning or deliberation (the "frame problem").
    *   The ETR aligns with Harman and Bratman's view that practical reasoning is a **dynamic process of revising intentions** (filtering or broadening prior intentions), rather than static selection from an exhaustive set.

2.  **Erotetic Reframing of BDI Components:**
    *   Koralus's ETR replaces the primitive notions of intention, belief, and desire with erotetic (question-based) counterparts, offering a more technical and flexible foundation.

3.  **Intentions → Decision Questions & Doings:**
    *   The ordinary concept of "intention" is deemed ambiguous (e.g., Knobe effect).
    *   The ETR introduces **"doings" (`do(A)`)** as technical instructions that various performance systems (motor or mental, like generating further inquiries) can carry out, with any state as a potential goal.
    *   **Pure Decision Questions (DQ)** are sets of alternative doings. These can be "open" (including the option `0`, or "do nothing") or "closed."
    *   The theory explains the **dynamic broadening of a prior decision question** by inquiring on additional doings, effectively expanding the set of alternatives being considered (e.g., from `{do(go north), 0}` to `{do(go north), do(go south), 0}`).

4.  **Beliefs → Direct Consequence Views (DCV):**
    *   Instead of complex "beliefs" about all possible outcomes, the ETR focuses on **"direct consequence views" (DCV)**. These are finite, often small sets of views about the immediate, salient consequences of specific doings.
    *   This approach addresses the "frame problem" by limiting the scope of consideration to what is *directly* relevant or has been dynamically inferred. DCVs can incorporate EAP weights (probabilities), as discussed in Chapter 5.

5.  **Desires → Priority Views:**
    *   The ETR critiques primitive "desires" for being dynamic, question-relative, and often systematic rather than "punctate" (isolated).
    *   It introduces **"priority views" (PR)**, which function as "pro tanto reasons." These are structured to update EAP weights based on the separable positive or negative bearing of features in a situation (e.g., "chocolate flavor" adding positive weight, "dairy content" adding negative).

6.  **Integrating Probabilities and Priorities with Double-Weights:**
    *   To accommodate both **multiplicative combination for uncertainty/probability** (from Chapter 5) and **additive combination for priorities**, the system introduces **"double-weights" (`mˣ.m'⁺`)**.
    *   The definitions of Equilibrium Answer Potential (EAP), Sum, and Product of views are extended to handle these double-weights, ensuring that probabilities combine multiplicatively and priorities combine additively.

7.  **Default Decision Procedure:**
    *   The **"default decision"** process for an erotetic agent involves:
        1.  Taking a decision question (DQ).
        2.  Updating it with relevant direct consequence views (CV).
        3.  Further updating it with applicable priority views (PR).
    *   The final decision favors the alternative doings that accumulate the highest combined "answer weight" (reflecting both their likely consequences and their alignment with priorities). This process acts as a "filtering" mechanism, similar to how BDI models revise intentions. The section notes that "attention" will play a crucial role in guiding issue structures for practical reasoning.

### Section 21

This section details how the Erotetic Theory of Inquiry (ETR) explains various systematic failures in decision-making, attributing them to different forms of "erotetic disequilibrium," and then connects the ETR to classical expected utility maximization under conditions of equilibrium, finally touching on the origins of decision questions.

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1.  **Failures as Erotetic Disequilibrium:** The ETR explains decision failures where objectively identical scenarios yield different choices by tracing them to a lack of erotetic equilibrium in the decision process.

2.  **Opportunity Cost Neglect (Example 90):** This failure occurs when the **decision question (DQ)** is imbalanced. A simple "buy or not buy" question (Condition A) fails to consider alternative purchases (`do(Ba)`) that would be brought up in a broader "buy video or buy something else" question (Condition B). The decision in Condition A is not in equilibrium with respect to the full set of relevant action possibilities.

3.  **Choosing vs. Rejecting (Example 92 - Custody Case):** This inconsistency arises from different initial **decision questions (DQ)**. "Awarding custody" focuses on positive traits, while "denying custody" focuses on negative ones, leading to selecting the same parent for both actions. An equilibrium decision would require considering both awarding and denying options simultaneously.

4.  **Asian Disease Problem (Example 93):** Framing effects here stem from a lack of equilibrium in the **consequence views (CVs)**. Presenting identical outcomes in terms of "people dying" vs. "people saved" leads to different choices because the agent's priorities interact differently with these frames. A rational judgment requires an "equilibrium basis view" of consequences that accounts for the interrelation between death and survival.

5.  **Decoy Effect (Example 91):** This phenomenon is explained as "over-concluding" or "jumping to conclusions." The presence of a "dominated" decoy option (e.g., a print-only subscription identical in price to a print-and-web option) creates an obvious "better than" inference that an erotetic agent treats as a maximally strong answer to the question of "what is best," thereby biasing the choice towards the dominating option without full consideration of other trade-offs.

6.  **Endowment Effect (Example 94):** This effect is linked to **ownership** making different aspects of an item salient. Owning an item (e.g., a mug) makes various alternative *uses* of it more prominent within the **decision question (DQ)**, thereby generating more reasons to keep it. This creates an asymmetry in the DQ compared to the alternative item offered for trade. Experienced traders do not exhibit the effect because their DQs evolve to treat items symmetrically as exchange value, promoting equilibrium.

7.  **Utility Maximization under Erotetic Equilibrium (Theorem 6.1):** The ETR bridges with classical rational choice theory by proposing that an erotetic agent in **erotetic equilibrium** (where DQs consider all action possibilities, and CVs are equilibrium basis views of total consequences) will effectively maximize expected utility.
    *   It's argued that for any utility function, a corresponding set of **priority views (PRs)** can be constructed to make the ETR's default decision procedure equivalent to expected utility maximization.
    *   Conversely, any set of PRs induces an "implied utility function" (sum of pro tanto reasons) such that the ETR's decision process aligns with maximizing expected utility based on that function. This positions classical rationality as a special case of ETR where optimal inquiry has been achieved.

8.  **Affordances and Action-Centered Priorities:** Addressing the question "where do questions come from?", the section posits that substantive questions (and thus `do` atoms, or potential actions) can arise *outside* explicit reasoning. It invokes Gibson's concept of **"affordances"** – the direct perception of what the environment "offers" an animal (e.g., a surface "looks sit-on-able"). These action-oriented perceptions can bypass full practical reasoning, providing a fundamental, non-inferential source for the alternatives considered in decision questions.

### Section 22

Part 22 further elaborates on the Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR) by integrating the concept of "affordances" into its framework, proposing an erotetic account of emotions and satisficing, and introducing the notions of "erotetic home" and "inquisitive load" as threats to agency.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Affordances and Action:**
    *   The section discusses Gibson's concept of **"affordances"**—the direct perception of opportunities for action in the environment—and its empirical support.
    *   It reviews the debate between "ecological/embodied" views (Gibson, Noë) and "representationalist" views (Prosser, Nanay, Siegel) on how affordances relate to action and experience.
    *   A key aspect of affordances is their "soliciting" nature, where perception can feel like an urgent invitation or mandate to act, potentially bypassing deliberation (e.g., in speed chess or tennis). This aspect challenges pure representationalist accounts.

2.  **ETR's Account of Affordances:**
    *   The ETR models affordance experiences as simple decision questions: **`{do(x), 0}`** (e.g., "do x?"). These have trivial accuracy conditions but presuppose that `do(x)` can be executed by the agent's performance systems (e.g., having the motor skills).
    *   To explain the direct link between affordances and action, the ETR suggests "degrading" the default decision procedure by skipping updates with consequence views and even priority views, leading directly to an intention: `{do(x), 0}A = {do(x)}`.
    *   More plausibly, the ETR introduces **"doings-centered priorities"** (deontological priorities), which, combined with rapid "gist" perception of circumstances, can trigger immediate actions without full deliberation (e.g., a priority to hit a ball in a tennis game when one is perceived to be playing tennis). This allows for rapid, context-sensitive action.

3.  **Emotions as Regulators of Inquiry:**
    *   Given that perfect "erotetic equilibrium" is resource-intensive and often impossible, the ETR proposes that emotions can serve as **"macro-cognitive states"** that regulate how many and what kinds of questions are raised.
    *   Examples: Fear might reduce further questions (decreasing false negatives in threat assessment); joy might reduce inquiry into alternatives (a signal of sufficient equilibrium); anxiety might increase consideration of alternatives (to avoid being blindsided); anger might make an agent less likely to adopt others' issues.
    *   This provides a non-evidentiary epistemic role for emotions, helping an erotetic agent maintain control and approximate rationality.

4.  **Satisficing as Restricted Equilibrium:**
    *   **Satisficing** (being content with "good enough" rather than optimal) is explained as a rational outcome of **"restricted erotetic equilibrium."** Agents rationally answer the questions they *do* raise, but do not necessarily raise questions about *all* possible alternatives.
    *   It is rational not to raise endless questions, especially when current circumstances are highly rewarding (e.g., enjoying dinner in a Tuscan villa). However, if a better option is *presented*, reason cannot ignore it.

5.  **Erotetic Home and Inquisitive Load:**
    *   An **"erotetic home"** is defined as an environment where an agent's default decision procedures, applied to normal views of their situation, effortlessly lead to equilibrium decisions. It is an environment of **low "inquisitive load."**
    *   **"Inquisitive load"** refers to the number of additional questions an agent must raise to achieve an equilibrium judgment. Modern life often increases inquisitive load (e.g., needing to understand global finance to make simple personal decisions), leading to **"inquisitive chaos."**

6.  **The Sphinx and Undermined Agency:**
    *   The **"Sphinx"** symbolizes external forces or circumstances that impose a high inquisitive load without necessarily worsening objective outcomes.
    *   When inquisitive load becomes too high, it becomes impossible for an agent to reasonably hope for erotetic equilibrium, thereby **undermining their agency** and making their decisions susceptible to external control or chance. This parallels concerns about freedom and domination in civic republicanism.

### Section 23

This section (Part 23) deepens the concept of **"inquisitive load"** as a significant threat to an agent's control and agency, illustrating its impact across various domains, from personal safety to societal governance.

Key points include:

1.  **Inquisitive Load in Everyday Threats:** The ETR argues that the **inquisitive load** (the cognitive burden of raising and answering questions to achieve equilibrium) generated by adaptive threats like terrorism or crime is disproportionately higher than for natural hazards (e.g., lightning strikes), even if objective statistical outcomes are similar. This constant need for vigilance and questioning undermines individual and societal agency. The same principle applies to navigating complex human relationships or living under tyranny.

2.  **Risk Pollution and System Interconnectedness:** The section introduces Adam Elga's concept of **"risk pollution,"** where innovations increasing interconnectedness (e.g., linked financial or power grid systems) create "tail risks" of total system collapse. While theoretically more efficient on average, these highly linked systems impose an insurmountable **inquisitive load** on human managers. Experimental evidence shows managers perform worse in such complex systems, failing to achieve equilibrium judgments due to the overwhelming number of inter-related questions, thus undermining their agency.

3.  **Democracy and Erotetic Equilibrium:**
    *   The ETR critiques purely **aggregative models of democracy** (e.g., simple voting) because aggregating individual judgments that are not in **erotetic equilibrium** (i.e., based on an insufficient scope of questions) does not genuinely reflect collective agency. It's akin to aggregating random choices.
    *   It argues for **deliberative democracy** as a superior model for erotetic agents. Deliberation provides a "third route" for changing judgments (beyond just new information or non-rational influence) by prompting individuals to consider new issues, thereby exposing and rectifying their pre-existing erotetic disequilibrium.
    *   This process, even when involving seemingly "ignorant" interlocutors, helps agents move closer to equilibrium, strengthening their individual agency and, consequently, enhancing the legitimacy and efficacy of collective group agency in a democracy.

4.  **Appendix A: Formal Definitions:** The section concludes with an appendix comprising comprehensive formulas and definitions (A.1 to A.86) outlining the formal structure of the Erotetic Theory of Reason from previous chapters (2, 4, and 5).

### Section 24

Part 24, titled **Appendix B: Meta-theory for Chapters 4 and 5**, provides the formal underpinnings for the Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR), focusing on dependency relations, the well-definedness of its predicate system, and the soundness of erotetic equilibrium inferences.

Key points include:

1.  **Theory of Dependency Relations (B.1):**
    *   **Alternative Characterization:** Introduces `δ-maps` as a formal way to represent dependency relations, mapping A-objects to numerical "depths" (`δ_R(a)`) to define existential (`E_δ`), universal (`U_δ`), and dependency (`D_δ`) elements. It proves a bijection between dependency relations and `δ-maps`.
    *   **Induced Ordering:** Defines relations `≲_R` and `≺_R` (pre-order and strict order) on A-objects based on their `δ_R` depths, providing an intrinsic characterization of these dependencies.
    *   **Composition Operations:** Formalizes how dependency relations can be combined:
        *   **Sequential Composition (Chain, ⋉):** Places one relation "below" another, making every existential in the lower relation dependent on every universal in the upper.
        *   **Parallel Composition (Fuse, ⋈):** Combines relations side-by-side. It introduces conditions like "compatibility" and "mutual acyclicity" for this operation to terminate and be well-defined.
    *   **Coherence:** Introduces the concept of "T-coherence" for a dependency relation `R` relative to another `T`, defining "relative depth" (`δ^T_R(a)`). This concept is crucial for understanding how relations interact and fuse. It culminates in **Theorem B.22**, showing that iterated T-fusion of a T-coherent set of relations is independent of the order, and **Corollary B.23**, which provides a one-step calculation for such fusions.

2.  **Predicate System Is Well Defined (B.2):**
    *   This section addresses meta-theoretic concerns, proving that the ETR's inference operations (Merge, Universal Product, Existential Sum, Query) are well-defined.
    *   It ensures that these operations deterministically produce unique, well-formed `v-models` (views), despite apparent choices in ordering or variable assignment. This relies heavily on the `T-coherence` and order-independence properties established in B.1.

3.  **Tarskian Realization (B.3):**
    *   Establishes the semantic link between ETR's formal "views" and classical first-order logic.
    *   Defines `pre-worlds` and `worlds` as structures for interpreting terms, propositional formulas, and quantifiers within first-order logic.
    *   Interprets a "view" (Γ_R) as a two-player game between "Player" (instantiating existentials) and "Opponent" (instantiating universals), where Player wins if the resulting assignment satisfies the view.
    *   Defines `Tarskian entailment` for views based on the existence of winning strategies for Player, showing equivalence between a view and its "matricial reduct" (Theorem B.24, Proposition B.26).

4.  **Soundness under Erotetic Equilibrium (B.4):**
    *   The central result of this section is **Theorem B.27 (Soundness of CETR inferences)**: If a view `D` is derivable from a set of views `G` in the ETR (`G |CETR D`), then `G` Tarskian entails `D` (`G ⊨ D`).
    *   The proof proceeds by induction on erotetic inferences, demonstrating the soundness of each individual ETR operation (Factor, Existential Sum, Universal Product, Inquire, Query, Wh-Query, Merge, Update, Answer) via a series of lemmas. Each lemma essentially shows that a winning strategy for the premise(s) can be extended to a winning strategy for the conclusion in any given world.

In essence, Part 24 is a rigorous logical appendix that formally validates the ETR's structural consistency, its computational determinism, its semantic interpretation in classical logic, and the reliability of its inferential steps in preserving truth (soundness).

### Section 25

Part 25, continuing Appendix B, provides critical meta-theoretical validations for the Erotetic Theory of Reason (ETR), focusing on **soundness**, **completeness**, and the **conservativity** of the extended ETR over its classical counterpart.

**1. Soundness of ETR Inferences (Completing B.4):**
*   **Lemma B.37 (Soundness of Suppose):** This lemma concludes the soundness proofs, demonstrating that the `Suppose` operation, when computed in complete erotetic equilibrium, preserves truth (i.e., the classical interpretation of the premise `G` is less than or equal to that of the suppositional view `G[D]^s`).
*   **General Soundness:** The section affirms that all ETR inferences previously introduced, including `Reorient`, `Depose`, and `Commit`, are sound, ensuring that they preserve truth from premises to conclusions.

**2. Completeness of ETR Inferences (B.5):**
*   This section establishes that the **erotetic equilibrium fragment** of ETR is complete with respect to classical reasoning. It is noted that general (non-equilibrium) erotetic inference is *not* complete and can lead to absurdity, hence the specific focus on the equilibrium subset.
*   **Theorem B.38 (Completeness of CETR inferences):** This central theorem asserts that if a conclusion is classically derivable from a set of hypotheses (under specific technical conditions on primitive absurdities `𝕂`), then it is also derivable within the complete erotetic equilibrium ETR (`CETR`).
*   **Herbrand’s Theorem for ETR (B.5.1):** The proof strategy for completeness leverages a modified **Theorem B.39 (Herbrand’s Theorem for CETR)**. This theorem states that if a conjunction of views classically entails absurdity, then it can be derived as absurd in CETR. The proof involves constructing a sequence of "normal views" (Definition B.15) and "reducts" (Definition B.16) to systematically build a model if a CETR refutation is not possible, thereby proving the contrapositive.
*   **Deduction and Completeness (B.5.2):** The final proof for Theorem B.38 utilizes auxiliary lemmas:
    *   **Lemma B.42 (Conjunctions):** Shows how multiple commitments can be conjoined into a single v-model using `Update` in complete equilibrium.
    *   **Lemma B.43 (Double negation elimination):** Demonstrates that applying the negation operation (`N`) twice effectively reverts a view to a semantically equivalent form.

**3. Conservativity of Extended Reasoning over Classical (B.6):**
*   This section defines the relationship between the classical ETR (Chapter 4) and the extended ETR (Chapter 5), which incorporates "weights" into views.
*   **Inclusion (`ι[-]`, Definition B.17) and Projection (`π[-]`, Definition B.18):** These mappings are introduced to convert between classical (unweighted) and extended (weighted with empty values) views, and vice-versa.
*   **Commutativity:** Operations are analyzed for "commutativity" with these mappings, indicating whether their behavior is preserved across the classical/extended distinction.
*   **Theorem B.44:** All reasoning operations of classical ETR commute with the inclusion `ι[-]`.
*   **Theorem B.45:** Most reasoning operations of extended ETR commute with the projection `π[-]`, meaning the extended system largely acts as a conservative extension of the classical one.
*   **Exceptions:** Key exceptions are `Answer` (via `Update` or `Suppose`), `Query`, and `Which`, which *do not* commute because their definitions explicitly inspect and depend on the input weights, thus introducing novel behavior in the extended system that goes beyond the classical.
*   **Lemma B.46:** Provides an illustrative proof that the `Product` operation commutes, explaining how the "empty weight" (`⟨⟨⟩⟩`) acts as a neutral element in weight arithmetic.

In summary, Part 25 provides the rigorous formal underpinnings that validate the ETR's logical integrity: demonstrating its inference steps preserve truth (soundness), proving that its equilibrium fragment is powerful enough to derive all classically valid conclusions (completeness), and clarifying how the more expressive "extended" ETR relates to the fundamental "classical" ETR, largely as a conservative, weight-agnostic extension.
