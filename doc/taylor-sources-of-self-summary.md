## Executive Summary

This comprehensive summary synthesizes the provided sections, outlining Charles Taylor's intricate project to articulate the "moral ontology" of modern identity, tracing its historical evolution, key concepts, and inherent conflicts.

### Comprehensive Final Summary

Charles Taylor's overarching project, as introduced in "Inescapable Frameworks," is to explore the "modern identity" by asserting that **selfhood and the good (or morality) are inextricably intertwined.** He argues that our deepest moral reactions are not mere instinctual feelings but involve **implicit "claims about the nature and status of human beings"** (a "moral ontology"), which cannot be dismissed by naturalism. Moral reasoning requires acknowledging these intrinsic properties, making our moral instincts our primary "mode of access" to discerning, arguing, and refining moral claims.

The document systematically traces the evolution of modern moral consciousness and the self through history, revealing a complex, often contradictory, "moral topography":

**1. The Inescapability of Frameworks and the Evolution of Inwardness:**
Taylor posits that humans cannot function without "moral frameworks" that include **"strong evaluation"** – qualitative distinctions that judge some ways of life or feelings as "incomparably higher" than others, independent of our desires. These frameworks are **constitutive of human identity**; losing them leads to a profound "identity crisis." Our self-definition arises from "webs of interlocution" – the social conversations that induct us into personhood. He traces the historical development of "inwardness":
*   **Plato's Self-Mastery:** Reason's rule over desires, accessing an **external, cosmic order of the Good**.
*   **Augustine's Radical Reflexivity:** A pivotal shift, emphasizing an **inner path to an external God** ("In interiore homine habitat veritas"), where the self-presence of the individual becomes crucial for accessing divine truth.
*   **Descartes's Disengaged Reason:** Further internalizing moral sources, reason becomes a faculty for **constructing knowledge and controlling passions**, leading to self-sufficient certainty and the ideal of becoming "masters and possessors of Nature." This establishes a procedural, rather than substantive, rationality.
*   **Locke's Punctual Self:** Extends disengagement and objectification, rejecting innate ideas and conceiving the self as an "extensionless" agent of **radical self-remaking** through conscious awareness and the instrumental regulation of desires.
*   **Montaigne's Self-Exploration:** Introduces a complementary strand of inwardness focused on exploring individual particularity, flux, and "unrepeatable difference" rather than universal truth.
This historical trajectory leads to the modern localization of "thought and feeling—the psychological—to minds," creating a sharp inner/outer dichotomy and fostering political atomism.

**2. The Affirmation of Ordinary Life and the Rise of Deism:**
A second crucial feature of modern identity is the **"affirmation of ordinary life"** – the valorization of labor, production, marriage, and family. This reverses traditional hierarchies that subordinated these activities to "higher" pursuits:
*   **The Reformation's Role:** Protestantism, especially Puritanism, provided the key impetus, hallowing mundane life as a "calling" to serve God's glory ("innerworldly asceticism"), thereby promoting a disciplined, rationalized work ethic and companionate marriage. This also provided a "hospitable environment" for Baconian science, seeing instrumental control as a pious purpose.
*   **Rationalized Christianity (Locke):** This fuses the affirmation of ordinary life with disengaged reason. Moral good is based on God's commands, made rationally discernible through instrumental reason and the pursuit of happiness ("self-love and social are the same").
*   **Moral Sentiments (Shaftesbury, Hutcheson):** A rival Deism emerges, emphasizing **intrinsic moral feelings** ("natural affection," "moral sense") over external commands. God's goodness is seen in a perfectly ordered, benevolent cosmos that elicits spontaneous love and benevolence.
Both Deist variants, though differing in their location of moral sources (rational control vs. re-engagement with sentiment), contribute to a human-centered providential vision where human happiness is a primary good.

**3. The Radical Enlightenment and its Counter-Movements:**
The **Radical Enlightenment** (e.g., Bentham, Holbach, Helvétius) pushes beyond Deism, rejecting providential order and basing ethics purely on **utility** (pleasure/pain). They champion **universal benevolence** and the **exaltation of sensual pleasure**, challenging religious asceticism. However, their **reductive materialist ontology** creates a paradox: it abolishes the space for "strong evaluation," making it impossible to coherently articulate the deep moral motivations (e.g., universal beneficence, relief of suffering) that drive their project. This "underdetermined ethical position" could lead to amorality (Sade) in the absence of an acknowledged moral horizon.

This leads to powerful **counter-Enlightenment movements**:
*   **Rousseau's "Nature as Source":** Rejects calculating reason and other-dependence, asserting the "voice of nature" (conscience) and the need for a **transformation of the will** to recover innate goodness. He greatly enlarges the scope of the "inner voice" as a moral source.
*   **Kant's Radical Autonomy:** Rejects utilitarianism, defining morality as **formal freedom** – conforming to the moral law dictated by reason itself, thereby emphasizing the unique **dignity of rational beings** as self-determining agents.
*   **The Expressivist Turn (Romanticism):** Building on Rousseau, this views **nature as an inner source** accessed through **sentiment**, emphasizing **expressive realization** as essential to human life. It champions **radical individuation**, seeing each person as unique with an obligation to live up to their originality, and elevates **art** as a central means of manifesting hidden truths and achieving self-completion. This sets the stage for a "spiral" view of history, aiming for higher reconciliations.

**4. The Post-Romantic Age: Modernism and the Conflicts of Modernity:**
The **Victorian era** grappled with the implications of these shifts, developing core modern moral imperatives: reduction of suffering, self-determination, universal justice, and equality. It also saw the rise of unbelief, rooted in a new "ethics of belief" that embraced the **heroism of confronting a bleak, unconsoling truth**.

**Modernist art** emerges as a further transformation. It continues the Romantic protest against instrumentalism but can no longer rely on nature as a source of spiritual solace due to industrialization and scientific disenchantment. Modernism manifests:
*   A turn **inward** (exploring subjectivity and consciousness) and a **decentering of the subject** (art revealing truth beyond mere self-expression).
*   **Transformations of Epiphanic Art**: From "epiphanies of being" (nature/art expressing good) to:
    *   **Realism/Naturalism**: Transfiguring the ordinary or meaningless, revealing "the real face of things" or the dignity of raw nature.
    *   **Baudelaire's Anti-Nature**: Epiphanies of ugliness and evil, where art corrects and transcends fallen nature, highlighting the artist's transmutative power.
    *   **Schopenhauer's Amoral Nature**: Art as a means to quiet the "blind striving" of an amoral "Will," or (for followers like Nietzsche) to transfigure this wild energy.
    *   **"Framing Epiphanies"**: (Pound) Truth found in the "force field" of juxtaposed images, making something indirectly available.
This leads to a "multi-levelled consciousness" aware of incompatible realities, and art itself becomes problematic and self-referential. Modernism's enduring aspiration is to recover moral/spiritual sources through "personal vision" and a "subtler language."

Ultimately, Taylor identifies **three major zones of conflict** in modern moral culture:
1.  **The issue about sources:** Widespread uncertainty regarding the fundamental "constitutive goods" that ground agreed-upon moral standards.
2.  **The issue about instrumentalism:** The battle between "disengaged instrumentalism" (emptying life of meaning, fragmenting self/society, leading to "disenchantment") and the Romantic/modernist protest seeking depth, connection, and spiritual resonance.
3.  **The issue about morality:** A tension between high moral demands (benevolence, justice) and other goods (aesthetic or expressive fulfillment), with some (Nietzsche, Foucault) suggesting incompatibility.

Taylor critiques dominant contemporary views for their "narrow sympathies" and "selective blindness," arguing that many deny or neglect essential human goods, particularly the "exploration of order through personal resonance." He suggests that while modern moral standards of justice and rights are vital, many other important aspects of life, including ecological responsibility and meaningful affiliations, depend on this often-ignored exploration. He expresses hope that the dilemma of spiritual "mutilation"—the cost of stifling our deepest aspirations—is not an "iron fate" but our "greatest spiritual challenge," implicitly suggesting a role for Judaeo-Christian theism in sustaining our moral drive.

### Document Structure:

The document is structured as a historical and philosophical genealogy of modern identity. It begins by establishing Taylor's core theoretical framework ("Inescapable Frameworks" - initial sections), then moves through distinct historical phases:
*   **Part I (implicit in early sections):** Laying the groundwork for moral ontology and the necessity of frameworks.
*   **Part II (Ch. 6-11):** The historical development of "Inwardness" (Plato, Augustine, Descartes, Locke, Montaigne).
*   **Part III (Ch. 12-19):** The "Affirmation of Ordinary Life" and its philosophical manifestations (Reformation, Puritanism, Deism, Radical Enlightenment).
*   **Part IV (Ch. 20-22):** The "Expressivist Turn" (Rousseau, Kant, Romanticism, Victorian developments).
*   **Part V (Ch. 23-24):** "Visions of the Post-Romantic Age" (Modernism, Epiphanic Art, the crisis of affirmation and its responses).
*   **Conclusion:** Taylor's final assessment of "The Conflicts of Modernity" and his own stance.
*   **Footnotes/Index:** Provides detailed scholarly support for the extensive historical and philosophical arguments.

## Individual Section Summaries

### Section 1

In the opening section, "Inescapable Frameworks," Charles Taylor introduces his project to explore the "modern identity," immediately asserting that **selfhood and the good (or morality) are inextricably intertwined.**

He critiques much of contemporary moral philosophy for its **narrow focus** on "what it is right to do" (obligation) over "what it is good to be" (the good life), arguing it neglects the concept of the good as an object of love or allegiance. Taylor aims to **broaden our understanding of moral and spiritual intuitions**, encompassing not only justice and respect but also concepts of dignity, meaningfulness, and fulfilling life, all of which involve "strong evaluation" – judgments of right/wrong, better/worse that are independent of our desires.

Taylor argues that deep moral reactions, such as respect for life, possess **two inseparable facets**: they are both powerful, almost instinctual feelings *and* they involve **implicit "claims about the nature and status of human beings"** (an "ontology of the human"). He rejects modern naturalism and empiricism's attempts to dismiss these ontological accounts as mere "froth" or irrelevant. He contends that moral reasoning, particularly the demand for consistency and the universal application of respect, *requires* acknowledging intrinsic properties of moral objects, differentiating them from "brute reactions" (like nausea).

Ultimately, Taylor concludes that moral argument cannot proceed from a neutral, scientific stance. Instead, our **deepest moral instincts and responses serve as our primary "mode of access" to the world** where moral ontological claims are discernible, rationally arguable, and can be refined.

### Section 2

Charles Taylor's central project is to articulate the "moral ontology"—the implicit background picture—that underlies and makes sense of our moral and spiritual intuitions. He emphasizes that this articulation is challenging because these ontologies are often implicit, people may resist acknowledging them (as with naturalists who deny moral ontology but then implicitly rely on new ones), and many moderns are genuinely uncertain, "groping for answers" about the foundations of their moral beliefs.

Taylor then delves into the unique features of modern Western moral intuitions, specifically concerning respect for human life. He notes a shift from an older "natural law" framework (focusing on what one must obey) to a new emphasis on **subjective rights**, which positions individuals as active agents in establishing and enforcing their own immunities. This highlights the centrality of **autonomy** in modern Western moral thought, where respecting a person involves respecting their self-direction and freedom to develop. Two other crucial features are the heightened importance placed on **avoiding suffering** (a sensitivity unique among civilizations, stemming from the decline of cosmic moral order and influencing utilitarianism) and the **affirmation of ordinary life** (production and family). This latter concept, rooted in the Reformation, elevates everyday life to the center of the good life, profoundly shaping modern society's understanding of well-being.

Expanding beyond just obligations to others, Taylor identifies three interconnected "axes" of moral thinking: **respect for and obligations to others**, **what constitutes a full life**, and **dignity** (our sense of commanding "attitudinal" respect from others, often linked to roles in ordinary life). He argues that the modern world is distinguished by a profound shift in the second axis: the **problem of meaning**. Unlike previous cultures where unchallengeable frameworks provided a clear "horizon" for understanding life's purpose, modern frameworks have become problematic or disintegrated ("disenchantment"). This leaves modern individuals in a unique existential predicament, embarking on a "quest" for a believable framework, where finding meaning is not a given but is intimately interwoven with their own powers of articulation and even invention.

### Section 3

This section of Charles Taylor's "Inescapable Frameworks" deepens the exploration of modern moral consciousness, contrasting past and present existential predicaments and firmly establishing the indispensable role of qualitative distinctions and frameworks in human identity and meaning.

Key points include:

1.  **Two Existential Predicaments:** Taylor distinguishes between an older predicament, exemplified by Luther, characterized by the **fear of irretrievable condemnation or exile** within an unquestionable, demanding moral order (not a crisis of meaning), and the modern predicament, which is the **fear of meaninglessness, emptiness, or a fracturing of one's world and self.** This shift in existential angst is mirrored in changing patterns of psychopathology, from Freudian-era hysterias to modern complaints of "ego loss" and lack of purpose.

2.  **The Necessity of Frameworks:** Taylor strongly refutes the naturalist tendency to dismiss "meaning" and "frameworks" as pseudo-questions or gratuitous inventions. He argues that this "radical reduction cannot be carried through."

3.  **Nature of Frameworks and Strong Evaluation:** Frameworks incorporate **crucial qualitative distinctions**, a sense that some actions, ways of life, or feelings are "incomparably higher" than others. These higher goods are not merely "more desirable" but command awe, respect, or admiration. This concept is intrinsically linked to **"strong evaluation,"** where these goods stand independent of our desires and serve as standards for judging them.

4.  **Historical Examples of Frameworks:** Taylor illustrates these frameworks with examples such as:
    *   The **honour ethic** (warrior/citizen life superior to private life).
    *   **Plato's ethic** (life ruled by reason, demanding a theoretical account).
    *   The **disengaged self** (modern variant of self-mastery through instrumental rationality).
    *   The **transformation of the will** (Christian grace, secularized into altruism as the "incomparably higher").
    *   The value placed on **vision and expressive power** in artistic creation, reflecting a modern intertwining of discovering meaning with inventing it.

5.  **The Affirmation of Ordinary Life:** He addresses the powerful modern "affirmation of ordinary life" (production, family), which historically challenged traditional, elitist frameworks. While naturalism and utilitarianism claim to reject all qualitative distinctions based on this affirmation, Taylor argues that they *themselves* establish a new distinction: dignity in a *certain manner* of living ordinary life (e.g., rationally, expressively) versus sloth or alienation.

6.  **Modern Moral Confusion:** This leads to a deep tension and confusion in modern moral consciousness—a struggle to affirm ordinary life while still holding onto a vision of the "incomparably higher."

7.  **Frameworks as Constitutive of Identity:** Moving into a new section, Taylor asserts his "strong thesis": doing without frameworks is "utterly impossible" for humans. Living within these "strongly qualified horizons" is **constitutive of human agency**, and to step outside them is to step outside "undamaged human personhood." He links this to **identity**, arguing that "Who am I?" is answered by understanding "where I stand" based on commitments and identifications that provide a moral horizon. Losing this leads to an "identity crisis," a profound disorientation in "moral space," sometimes even linked to physical spatial disorientation. He concludes by noting the historical specificity of modern "identity" talk, which recognizes individual moral horizons unlike older, more universally framed moral questions.

### Section 4

This section deepens Charles Taylor's argument for the inescapable nature of moral frameworks and then introduces his "strong thesis" about the social constitution of the self.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Identity, Moral Orientation, and Inescapable Frameworks:**
    *   Taylor reiterates that our identity is defined by "where we stand" in "moral space," answering the question "Who am I?" This orientation is fundamental to being a human "interlocutor" capable of answering for oneself.
    *   This moral space is inherently mapped by **"strong evaluations" or "qualitative distinctions,"** meaning some ways of life or goods are "incomparably higher." Identity itself is a strongly valued good, something one ought to uphold.
    *   The naturalist idea that frameworks are merely invented and can be dispensed with is **"wildly wrong."** The space of moral questions *pre-exists* us and is **inescapable**, much like the need for spatial orientation. To lack a framework is not just abnormal but constitutes an "appalling identity crisis" or "frightening dissociation"—a pathological state outside the bounds of "undamaged human personhood."
    *   Even seemingly framework-free approaches like utilitarianism operate within a hidden moral horizon (e.g., valuing rationality and benevolence) that their own theory cannot fully explicate.

2.  **The Self is Not an Object (and its Social Constitution):**
    *   Taylor defines "self" as a being with the "requisite depth and complexity" to have an identity, characterized by its essential **orientation to the good** and what "matters" to it. He distinguishes this from other psychological concepts like chimp self-recognition, the Freudian Ego (a "lucid calculator of pay-offs"), or concern for social image.
    *   He argues the self cannot be treated like a classical scientific object because:
        *   It is defined by what has **significance** for it.
        *   It is constituted by **self-interpretations**, which are never fully explicit.
        *   Crucially, **a self exists only among other selves** and cannot be understood without reference to its surroundings.

3.  **"Webs of Interlocution" as Constitutive of Identity:**
    *   Our self-definition ("Who am I?") originates in the **"interchange of speakers."** We are inducted into personhood and learn languages of moral discernment by being brought into "ongoing conversation" within a "common space" with others.
    *   This leads to the concept of **"webs of interlocution":** a self exists only in relation to these conversation partners, both those who helped form one's identity and those crucial to its ongoing understanding. Identity thus involves both one's moral stand and one's defining community.
    *   Even highly independent modern individuals or historical figures who stood against their communities (e.g., prophets, Socrates) do not escape these webs. Instead, they **transform** their interlocutory community, defining themselves in relation to a "saving remnant," "like-minded souls," or "company of philosophers." Our ability to articulate original thought still depends on confronting it with the language and reactions of others, in a "transcendental" sense.
    *   This refutes theories (like those of Hobbes or Locke) that envision language as inventable by individuals or allow for "private languages," emphasizing the fundamental social and dialogical nature of human selfhood and meaning.

### Section 5

This section further develops Taylor's argument for the inescapable nature of social identity and introduces the crucial role of narrative in understanding one's moral life.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Illusions of Radical Independence:** Taylor debunks the notion of a self that is entirely self-sufficient, drawing its purposes solely from within. He argues that even the most "independent" stances are deeply rooted in **"webs of interlocution"** (social conversation and interaction). The American tradition of "leaving home" and forging one's own path, for instance, is presented as a culturally defined expectation and tradition, not an escape from social embedding.
2.  **Cultural Differences in Identity Formation:** He contrasts the Western emphasis on individual identity, often developed against social opposition, with an Indian pattern that prioritizes identity formed through "the confirming presence of the loved person" and social reliance (citing Sudhir Kakar). Taylor warns against **ethnocentrism** in judging these different cultural patterns, emphasizing that both are traditions reflecting distinct ways of realizing the universal "transcendental conditions" of human selfhood.
3.  **Two Aspects of Moral Orientation:** Moving beyond frameworks, Taylor explains that human orientation in "moral space" requires two things, akin to physical orientation:
    *   **Having a map:** Understanding the "qualitatively higher" goods (the frameworks).
    *   **Placing oneself on the map:** A sense of *where we stand* in relation to these goods.
4.  **The Ineradicable Craving for the Good:** Humans possess a fundamental, "ineradicable craving" to be connected to or rightly placed in relation to what they perceive as good, important, or valuable. This aspiration is essential for being a "functional human agent" and is intrinsically linked to questions about the "worthwhileness" or "meaningfulness" of one's life. While the terminology may be modern, this core need echoes ancient aspirations for "higher being" or "immortality."
5.  **Absolute vs. Relative Moral Questions:** This craving manifests in diverse ways (e.g., religious devotion, honor, self-mastery, family life, expressive creation). Taylor distinguishes between:
    *   **Relative questions:** How near or far we are from the good (a "more-or-less" measure).
    *   **Absolute questions:** The fundamental "yes-or-no" question of the *direction* of our lives—whether we are moving *towards* or *away from* the good, or what constitutes the ultimate source of our motivations. He argues that this absolute question is inescapable because human lives are dynamic, constantly changing and becoming, requiring a definitive stance on our life's overall trajectory.
6.  **The Necessity of Narrative:** Finally, Taylor asserts that making sense of our lives and having an identity fundamentally requires understanding them as an **"unfolding story" or "narrative."** Drawing on Heidegger, he explains that our present actions and moral position are understood by integrating them into a coherent story of how we have become and where we are going. Genuine moral growth and assessment cannot be understood in isolated moments but demand an interpretation within the broader narrative of one's life and continuous striving.

### Section 6

This section deepens Charles Taylor's argument for the inescapable narrative structure of human identity and then pivots to a critical examination of how qualitative distinctions function in moral thought.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Narrative as Essential for Self-Understanding (Continuing from Section 5):**
    *   Making sense of one's present moral position requires a **narrative understanding** of one's life, integrating past striving, moral experience, and future projections. Life is a continuous "quest" for what one is not yet.
    *   Taylor argues against views (like Derek Parfit's, building on Locke/Hume) that suggest personal identity can be fragmented or arbitrarily defined (e.g., viewing one's past or future self as a different person). These views treat the self as a "punctual" or "neutral" object, defined solely by self-awareness, devoid of constitutive concerns.
    *   For Taylor, the self exists *only* in a "space of moral issues," defined by what has significance for it and its orientation to the good. This inherently requires a **unified life story** with temporal depth, where past "maturations and regressions" are understood as part of a continuous becoming.
    *   The "craving for meaning" extends to one's **whole life**, implying a desire for the future to "redeem" the past and integrate all experiences into a meaningful unity (e.g., Proust's recovery of lost time). To repudiate one's past is a "mutilation" of self.
    *   Thus, there is an **a priori unity of a human life** through its whole extent, which is not arbitrarily determinable, except possibly in highly distinct cultural contexts. The narrative understanding of life as a "quest" and the inescapable orientation to the good are "connected facets of the same reality, inescapable structural requirements of human agency."

2.  **Critique of "Ethics of Inarticulacy" (Beginning of Chapter 3):**
    *   Taylor shifts focus to the role of **qualitative distinctions in moral judgment**, challenging the widespread rejection of "naturalistic fallacy" and "is/ought" distinctions. He attributes these rejections to modern naturalism and subjectivism, which view "values" as mere subjective "projections" onto a neutral world.
    *   He identifies two versions of the "projection" view: values as voluntary constructs (Hare's prescriptivism) or as involuntary but non-real experiences (sociobiology's secondary qualities analogy). Both attempt to separate a "descriptive" meaning from an "evaluative" one.
    *   Following Bernard Williams, Taylor argues that **many key value terms (e.g., 'courage,' 'brutality') lack purely descriptive equivalents.** Their "evaluative point" is integral to their meaning and cannot be grasped if one prescinds from it.
    *   Understanding value terms requires two "orders of considerations":
        *   **Social interchange:** Grasping the common purposes, mutual needs, and social context of a society.
        *   **Qualitative discriminations:** Understanding the society's perceptions of the good.
    *   While some rules (like those against killing) might be partly understood through functional social requirements, most value terms, especially virtues, require grasping a vision of the good.
    *   Taylor refutes the conclusion that values are "merely relative" because they depend on human understanding and social contexts. While not properties of the universe independent of humans, once human existence is granted, they are **"as real, objective, and non-relative as any other part of the natural world"** for humans. He rejects the natural science model as the sole measure of reality for human affairs.

3.  **The "Best Account" (BA) Principle:**
    *   Taylor proposes that the **"best measure of reality" in human affairs** comes from "those terms which on critical reflection and after correction of the errors we can detect make the best sense of our lives." This includes offering the most realistic orientation about the good and allowing us to understand our actions, feelings, and those of others.
    *   He emphasizes the **indispensability of certain terms** (e.g., 'dignity,' 'courage') in our first-person deliberations and assessments, arguing that explanatory theories cannot simply discard them as "mere appearance."
    *   The terms we *live by* and use for deliberation cannot be removed from the object of explanation unless more "clairvoyant substitutes" are offered. The "Best Account" principle asserts that this account is "trumps," overriding general epistemological or metaphysical considerations from natural science.
    *   Human reality, including our value terms, cannot be reduced to or understood solely by physics. It represents a distinct reality, dependent on our existence, but objective once we exist.

### Section 7

This section deepens Charles Taylor's critique of non-realist positions concerning moral values and introduces the concept of "hypergoods" as central to moral identity and cross-cultural judgment.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Critique of Non-Realism (Projection View):** Taylor launches a three-phase attack against naturalism-inspired non-realist views (e.g., Mackie, Williams, Blackburn) that see values as subjective "projections" onto a neutral world, or as metaphysically "queer."
    *   **Phase 1: Indispensability Argument:** Humans *cannot help* but have recourse to strongly valued goods (e.g., courage, justice) for everyday life purposes like deliberation, judgment, and self-understanding. These terms are indispensable for making sense of our lives and others'.
    *   **Phase 2: Reality as What Must Be Dealt With:** What we cannot help but rely on in life is, by that token, real. Our general metaphysical picture of "values" should be *based on* this lived reality, not be used to object to it. Non-realists implicitly feel this tension, leading them to try and show their theories are compatible with ordinary morality, but this often renders moral experience irrelevant to the status of the good, violating this second point.
    *   **Phase 3: Incoherent Mixtures:** Many non-realists inconsistently try to be compatible with moral experience while also shifting to sociobiological or consequentialist ethics, which Taylor argues fundamentally undermine the concept of moral obligation inherent in "strong evaluation." They "fudge" the fact that non-realism undercuts morality.

2.  **Cultural Relativism and Incommensurability:** Taylor addresses the concern that differing cultural values might be incommensurable (no way to judge one as a gain or loss over another). While he acknowledges this as a "real possibility," he doubts its truth. He distinguishes it from situations where comparing cultures involves both gains and losses (e.g., modern science vs. lost community sense), which he argues is *not* true relativization because it still presupposes the recognition of universal goods. He suggests we should not assume incommensurability a priori and should strive to understand goods as potentially universal until a clear limit is met.

3.  **Hypergoods: Overriding Moral Commitments:** Taylor introduces the concept of "hypergoods." While individuals are moved by many goods, they often rank them, with some becoming "supremely important." These hypergoods are:
    *   **Identity-Defining:** Orientation toward a hypergood is "utterly decisive" for one's identity; moving away from it would be "devastating."
    *   **Higher-Order Distinctions:** They represent "qualitative discontinuities," incomparably higher than other goods (e.g., love of God/justice is higher than expressive fulfillment).
    *   **Defining "The Moral":** In our culture, hypergoods often define "the moral" as a set of ends or demands that have unique importance and *override* and allow judgment of other goods (e.g., Kant's categorical imperative).

4.  **Hypergoods as Sources of Conflict and Critical Supersession:** Hypergoods are inherently conflictual. They frequently arise through **historical supersession** of earlier, less adequate views (e.g., universal respect superseding restricted ethics; Platonism/Judeo-Christianity challenging honor ethics). This "transvaluation of values" means hypergoods serve as standards to radically criticize and sometimes reject other, ordinary goods and practices, both within one's own society and across cultures.

5.  **Strategies for Dealing with Hypergoods (Plato vs. Aristotle):**
    *   **Revisionist (Plato):** Denies the credentials of any goods that conflict with the hypergood (e.g., denying family life to guardians in the *Republic*).
    *   **Comprehending (Aristotle):** Affirms all goods, seeing the "supreme good" as the whole good life with goods in proper proportion, hierarchically ranked by priority but not denied. Taylor finds this difficult for moderns given our recognition of vicious social forms (e.g., Aristotle's justification of slavery) which our hypergoods condemn.

6.  **Reaffirming Cross-Cultural Critical Claims:** Taylor challenges a "sophisticated naturalism" that, while accepting the reality of values, makes them strictly relative to a "form of life," thereby precluding objective cross-cultural moral judgment. He argues that hypergoods, by their very nature, make "pitiless criticism" of beliefs and practices (e.g., condemning slavery, female circumcision) and this critical radicalism should not stop at cultural boundaries. He reaffirms that these value-properties are "no less real features of the world" than "neutral" properties, drawing on the "best account" principle: what is real is what our best explanation of human life *must* invoke.

### Section 8

This section deepens Charles Taylor's arguments regarding the reality of moral terms and the nature of practical reasoning, especially in the context of "hypergoods."

Here's a concise summary of the key points:

1.  **Applying the "Best Account" (BA) Principle to Human Affairs:**
    *   Taylor extends the "Best Account" (BA) principle (from Section 7) to human life: the vocabulary and terms (e.g., 'courage,' 'generosity') that offer the most realistic and insightful explanation for our deliberations, assessments, and understanding of human actions and character should be considered **real features of our world**.
    *   He argues against allowing an "absolute account" (like natural science, which abstracts from anthropocentric properties and meanings) to dictate our ontology for human affairs, as it's inherently insufficient for explaining human life.

2.  **Hypergoods as Epistemologically Unsettling:** Taylor identifies two main reasons why hypergoods (supremely important, identity-defining goods) are more unsettling and prone to skeptical reactions than ordinary moral terms:
    *   **Challenge and Displacement of Other Goods:** Hypergoods involve "growth," "sanctification," or "higher consciousness" that inherently challenge, re-evaluate, and often repudiate earlier or "ordinary" goods (e.g., Plato's Good, Christian *agapé*, universal respect transforming views of historical cultures). This inherent struggle and disagreement, amplified by modern rejections of "higher" ideals in favor of "ordinary life," fuels moral skepticism and naturalist reactions.
    *   **Critiques of Hypergoods' Origins:** He acknowledges historical critiques, such as Nietzsche's "genealogy" (which portrays the rise of morality as a "slave morality" of repression) and Neo-Nietzschean analyses (e.g., Foucault) that show how hypergoods can be woven into systems of social exclusion and dominance. While these critiques are powerful, they often derive their force from rival hypergoods, and don't provide an *a priori* argument against the reality of *all* hypergoods. The "Best Account" principle remains the only way to evaluate them.

3.  **The Nature of Practical Reason as "Reasoning in Transitions":**
    *   Taylor rejects the "bad model" of practical reason (rooted in naturalist epistemology) that demands arguments based on "external criteria" capable of convincing someone who shares *no* basic moral intuitions. Such a demand is a "proposal to change the subject."
    *   Instead, practical reasoning is a "reasoning in transitions": it aims to show that one moral position (B) is **superior** to another (A) by demonstrating that the move from A to B constitutes an "error-reducing" gain (e.g., resolving a contradiction, acknowledging a previously ignored factor). This form of argument is often rooted in biographical narrative and one's understanding of moral growth.
    *   Therefore, challenges to hypergoods (like Nietzsche's genealogies) operate by offering alternative interpretations of the *transition* to those goods, aiming to show them as illusory or based on error.

4.  **Transcendent Referents and the Role of Moral Intuitions:**
    *   The second unsettling aspect of hypergoods is their frequent reference to **transcendent realities** (e.g., God, Plato's Idea of the Good, Romantic Nature). While these don't feature in natural science, the BA principle suggests that if they are essential to our *best account of the human moral world*, they should be accepted.
    *   Taylor clarifies that accepting such transcendent goods is not about proving their existence independently and then deducing morality (the "Platonic synthesis," now shattered). Rather, acceptance of a hypergood is "complexly connected with our being moved by it."
    *   He refutes the reductionist/subjectivist argument that this "seeing and feeling" connection means values are *mere projections*. Instead, we experience being moved *by what is good in the good*, and our love for it feels "well-founded."
    *   Any critique of a hypergood (e.g., showing it's a projection of ordinary desires) must itself be a transition argument, and "what successfully resists all such critique is my (provisionally) best account."
    *   He uses the analogy of **perceptual knowledge**: our confidence in perception rests on an "inarticulate sense of purchase" on reality, which we refine through experience but cannot validate by stepping entirely outside perception itself. Similarly, we cannot step outside our moral intuitions to validate them; our most reliable moral views are grounded in our strongest intuitions that have successfully met challenges through error-reducing transitions.

5.  **Qualitative Distinctions Provide Reasons (Clarified Role):** Taylor distinguishes how qualitative distinctions (QDs) provide reasons in moral thinking:
    *   **Not External Reasons:** They don't offer external considerations to convince someone unmoved by a vision of the good. Instead, they offer reasons by **articulating what is crucial to the shape of the moral world** in one's best account, helping to define identity.
    *   **Not Basic Reasons:** They are not "basic reasons" that asymmetrically confer obligation (e.g., 'conducing to the greatest happiness'). He critiques modern moral philosophy's "breathtaking systematization" around a single basic reason (e.g., utilitarianism, Kantianism), contrasting it with Aristotle's more pluralistic view of goods.
    *   **Articulating the Moral Point:** QDs provide reasons by **articulating what underlies our ethical choices, leanings, and intuitions**, setting out the "moral point" of our actions. This articulation speaks "for you" by clarifying existing intuitions or moving you to adopt new ones.
    *   Ultimately, the entire study struggles against the "naturalist temper" to establish that these qualitative distinctions and the "frameworks" they define are not optional but provide an **essential orientation to our identity**.

### Section 9

This section argues that modern moral philosophy (exemplified by Utilitarianism and certain Kantian traditions) significantly contributes to the "bewitchment" against acknowledging "qualitative distinctions" (QDs) or "hypergoods" – a suppression even stronger than mere naturalistic reductionism.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Modern Moral Philosophy's Rejection of Qualitative Distinctions:**
    *   **Narrow Focus on Obligatory Action:** Modern moral theory is primarily concerned with what is *right to do* (obligatory action), rather than what is *good to be* or the *nature of the good life*. It seeks to define the content of obligation through universal criteria or procedures, excluding the role of QDs which articulate the "point" or "meaning" of moral actions.
    *   **Rejection of "Higher" Goods:** Utilitarianism, in particular, explicitly aims to abolish qualitative discrimination, reducing all goods to "desire" and focusing on maximization of fulfillment. While Taylor notes utilitarians implicitly hold "rationality" and "benevolence" as higher motives, their explicit theory denies such distinctions.
    *   **Kantian Drift:** While Kant rehabilitated the distinction between duty and inclination, his emphasis on freedom as self-determination and the moral law emanating from the will led him to reject QDs rooted in an external "order of nature." His followers often extended this to a rejection of *any* distinctions, overlooking his doctrine of the dignity of rational agents.

2.  **Complex Motivations for this Suppression:**
    *   **Epistemological & Metaphysical (Naturalism):** The "naturalist temper" and its epistemological assumptions (science as the paradigm for knowledge) make "higher goods" appear strange, as they don't fit into a physics-driven ontology. This encourages describing human affairs in "external, non-culture-bound terms," avoiding the "thick description" that QDs require.
    *   **Moral Motives:**
        *   **Affirmation of Ordinary Life:** Suspicion of "higher" demands that challenge everyday goals, often framed as a liberation from restrictive or "crushing" moral burdens (e.g., Christian sense of sin, "guilt trips").
        *   **Avoidance of Self-Delusion/Smugness:** QDs can lead to illusions, self-satisfaction, or smug comparison with others.
        *   **Modern Freedom (Self-Determination):** The modern concept of freedom emphasizes the subject's independence and self-determination, where normative orders originate in the will rather than in an external "natural order" (as in Plato or Aristotle). This motive is central to Kant, Hobbes, and utilitarian anti-paternalism.
        *   **Practical Benevolence/Altruism:** An Enlightenment ideal of actively improving the human condition (relieving suffering, increasing welfare) leads to an exclusive focus on action. Concern for "higher goods" or one's "soul" is seen as self-absorbed and narcissistic, rather than altruistic.
        *   **Desire for Universal Ethic:** QDs are often culturally embedded; rejecting them is seen as a way to avoid "parochial" ethical principles and achieve a fully universal morality (e.g., Habermas).

3.  **Shift to Procedural Reasoning:**
    *   Because modern moral theory sidelines visions of the good, practical reason is redefined as "procedural" rather than "substantive."
    *   **Substantive Reason (Ancient):** Rationality involves having the *correct vision* of the good (e.g., Plato's Good, Aristotle's *phronesis*).
    *   **Procedural Reason (Modern):** Rationality is judged by *how* one thinks, not the substantive correctness of the outcome (e.g., utilitarian maximizing calculation, Kantian universalization, Habermas's uncoerced dialogical acceptance). This shift is strongly tied to the modern idea of freedom and self-determination.

4.  **Perplexing Gaps and "Fudgings":**
    *   This suppression of QDs leaves modern moral theories with "perplexing gaps" and an inability to fully account for moral experience.
    *   They cannot capture the "background understanding" or the "incomparably important" nature of strong goods that underlie moral convictions.
    *   They struggle to explain the source of moral motivation or why certain considerations hold "special priority."
    *   Questions like "Why should I be moral?" can only be answered in prudential terms (Hare), without offering insight into the unique value or point of moral injunctions, leading to a "skewed" and incomplete conception of morality.

In essence, Taylor argues that modern moral philosophy, driven by a confluence of epistemological/naturalist, moral, and freedom-centered motives, actively suppresses essential qualitative distinctions, thereby creating theories of "obligatory action" that are procedurally focused but ultimately unable to capture the rich, identity-defining, and deeply felt aspects of human moral life.

### Section 10

This section, continuing the critique of modern moral philosophy from Section 9 and introducing a new focus on "moral sources," makes the following key points:

1.  **The "Segregating Boundary" and Pragmatic Contradiction of Modern Ethics:**
    *   Modern procedural ethics (e.g., Habermas), needing to universalize, fiercely defends a boundary between universal demands of justice ("ethics") and culture-specific notions of the "good life." This boundary, though often inadequately explained, is their only way to mark certain considerations as incomparably higher and to prevent ethnocentric aggression.
    *   Paradoxically, these theories of obligatory action are motivated by strong moral ideals – modern hypergoods like freedom, altruism, and universalism. Yet, these very ideals drive theorists to deny or denature *all* such goods, creating a "pragmatic contradiction." They are "constitutionally incapable" of acknowledging their own deeper moral sources.

2.  **Critique of the "Priority of the Right over the Good":**
    *   Taylor acknowledges the Kantian origin of this principle as a valid counter-attack against utilitarian consequentialism.
    *   However, he argues it's often misused to downgrade *any* conception of the good, including the qualitative distinctions underlying our moral views.
    *   Rawls's attempt to derive justice from a "thin theory of the good" is deemed incoherent; it implicitly relies on a "thick" theory of the good (our moral intuitions) that remains unarticulated but essential for recognizing adequate principles of justice.
    *   Taylor proposes an inversion: if "good" refers to qualitative distinctions, then the "good is always primary to the right" because its articulation gives "the point of the rules which define the right."

3.  **Consequences of Suppression:**
    *   Modern moral philosophy, driven by metaphysical, epistemological, and moral ideas, narrows moral focus to action determinants, defines practical reason as exclusively procedural, and mystifies the priority of morality by identifying it with a form of reasoning rather than substantive goods.
    *   This leads to defending an arbitrary boundary around "the moral," often unifying the moral domain around a single, distorting consideration (a "Procrustes bed").
    *   The exclusive focus on obligations distorts moral thinking, neglecting aspirations, perfection, and heroism.
    *   Taylor concludes that we must "fight uphill to rediscover the obvious" place of qualitative distinctions in moral life, countering layers of suppression.

4.  **Introduction of "Moral Sources" (Section 4.1):**
    *   **The Importance of Articulacy:** Goods (e.g., God, universal rights) only become possibilities for us through articulation (narrative, theology, ritual, visual symbols, etc.). Taylor aligns with a "Socratic" view that articulacy about what moves us is part of human *telos*.
    *   **Articulation and Moral Sources:** The central idea is that articulation brings us closer to the "good" (defined as whatever is picked out as incomparably higher by a qualitative distinction) as a **moral source**, giving it power.
    *   **Constitutive Goods:**
        *   These are realities (e.g., Plato's Idea of the Good, the God of Abraham) that not only *define* "life goods" (facets of a good life) but also *empower* us to do and be good through our love or respect for them. Loving a constitutive good is part of being a good human.
        *   Modern theories of obligatory action, which deny life goods, naturally have no place for constitutive goods.

5.  **The Internalizing Move of Modern Humanism:**
    *   Modern humanism (e.g., Kant) rejects external constitutive goods. The constitutive good becomes **immanent**: rational agency (Kant), or human dignity found in courageous disengagement from a meaningless universe (Pascal's "thinking reed").
    *   The empowering motive shifts from "love" to "respect" or awe.
    *   Taylor argues that despite this "revolution in moral consciousness" and the shift in terms, something **analogous** still functions as a moral source, defining what is higher and empowering us. We must not lose sight of this continuity.

6.  **Articulacy's Challenges and Power in Modernity:**
    *   Modern individuals often struggle to articulate the foundations of their moral sense (e.g., rights, traditional frameworks). Even powerful images and stories (Plato's sun, Exodus narrative) can inspire and empower even when their original theological or metaphysical underpinnings are lost.
    *   Articulacy is vital because it brings moral sources closer, makes them evident, and releases their inherent force, inspiring love, respect, or allegiance.
    *   However, Taylor acknowledges the dangers of articulation: it can be trite, counterfeit, used for self-conceit or sinister purposes (e.g., Nuremberg), or lead to delusion.

7.  **The Overwhelming Case for Articulation (Section 4.2):**
    *   Despite the dangers, complete inarticulacy would sever all contact with the good, diminishing our humanity.
    *   Taylor strongly argues against the "silence of modern philosophy," which he finds "unhealthy" and "intellectually asphyxiating." This silence stems from invalid metaphysical/epistemological reasons and confused moral/spiritual motives that misinterpret freedom and the affirmation of ordinary life as requiring a repudiation of qualitative distinctions and constitutive goods.
    *   Articulating the good is crucial to escape this spell, resolve confusions, and allow for crucial questions about the validity of hypergoods.

### Section 11

This section, continuing Taylor's critique of modern moral philosophy, first addresses and dismisses "neo-Nietzschean" critiques before outlining the methodology for his own project of articulating the good.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Critique of Neo-Nietzscheanism:**
    *   **Partial Agreement:** Taylor acknowledges that neo-Nietzscheans (like Foucault) correctly identify the hidden moral motivations behind procedural ethics, challenging their claim to be purely epistemic.
    *   **Fundamental Disagreement:** Neo-Nietzscheans argue that all moral/intellectual positions are arbitrary "regimes of truth" imposed on reality, with no position more justified than another, ultimately based on "fiat." Taylor deems this "deeply implausible" and a "form of self-delusion," incompatible with how humans actually live and deliberate about their moral lives. It violates the "best available account" (BA principle).
    *   **Lack of Self-Lucidity:** Taylor argues that neo-Nietzscheans, similar to mainstream naturalists, also suffer from a lack of self-lucidity. They claim a false distance from their own value commitments, believing their lucidity about "constructed orders" makes them uniquely free from delusion, a claim Taylor finds unfounded.
    *   **Valid Insight:** Despite his criticisms, Taylor recognizes the neo-Nietzschean insight that visions of the good can be deeply connected to forms of domination and inequality (e.g., warrior ethics, "higher" ideals suppressing "nature").

2.  **The Persistent Need for Articulacy:**
    *   Taylor reiterates that both mainstream moral philosophy (which shuns articulation) and neo-Nietzscheanism (which discredits hypergoods via an unsustainable meta-doctrine) impede clear thinking.
    *   **Advancing Moral Debate:** Articulating underlying goods is crucial for moving beyond incoherent, self-deluding theories and addressing complex conflicts in modern culture.
    *   **Addressing Hypergood Conflicts:** Articulacy is essential to navigate the tension between modern hypergoods (universal respect, self-determining freedom) and "ordinary goods" (community, friendship, identity, sensuality). Mainstream philosophy, with its unitary focus, cannot grasp this diversity, while neo-Nietzscheanism dissolves it.
    *   **Overcoming Human-Centrism (Subjectivism):** Both approaches contribute to a "profound skew" towards human-centered goods (freedom, benevolence, rights), occluding "extra-human" claims (e.g., the value of non-human nature, the non-instrumental good of truth). These frameworks are "blinkers" that prevent acknowledgment of the full force of goods.

3.  **Methodology: History as the "Great Recourse" (Section 4.3):**
    *   Articulating the good requires not just recording stated positions but often "inventing language" to make explicit what has remained implicit, especially in philosophies that deny their own underlying moral outlooks.
    *   **Historical Enterprise:** Understanding modern views requires tracing their development from past positions (models or foils).
    *   **Unearthing Suppressed Goods:** Crucially, to understand modern naturalist views that suppress their underlying goods, one must turn to earlier religious or metaphysical views where these goods were openly avowed (e.g., the theological origins of the "affirmation of ordinary life"). This helps reveal how modern naturalism still draws spiritual energy from predecessors it explicitly rejects.
    *   This historical tracing must encompass not just philosophical theories but also "mentalités" (widespread attitudes).

4.  **Anticipated Findings: The Complex, Conflictual Modern Moral Predicament (Section 4.4):**
    *   Taylor expects this historical articulation to reveal our moral predicament as more complex and conflictual. We "are and cannot but be on both sides" of the disputes between hypergoods and the goods sacrificed in their name.
    *   **Identity and Moral Topography:** This "must" stems from our identity: visions of the good are intertwined with understandings of the self, narratives of life, and conceptions of society. These four terms (goods, self, narrative, society) evolve together in "loose 'packages.'"
    *   Modern thought, by ignoring the good, suppresses this "moral topography" of the self, treating selves as interpretation-free givens.
    *   **Goal of Articulacy: Reconciliation:** Articulacy aims to enable reconciliation, allowing us to recognize the full range of goods we live by and to prevent our strongest aspirations towards hypergoods from leading to "self-mutilation." It opens us to our moral sources, releasing their force. Even if reconciliation is impossible, it ends the "stifling of the spirit."

The section concludes by setting the stage for **Part II: Inwardness (Chapter 5)**, where Taylor will historically trace the rise and development of the modern sense of "inwardness" – the idea that thoughts, feelings, and capacities are "within" us – as a historically limited mode of self-interpretation linked to our moral sources.

### Section 12

This section, Chapter 6 titled "Plato's Self-Mastery," inaugurates Part II: Inwardness, by first exploring the historical contingency of the modern concept of "self" and "inner/outer" and then contrasting it with Plato's moral philosophy.

Here are the key points:

1.  **The Historical Contingency of the Self and Inwardness:**
    *   Taylor argues that while a basic, shared sense of "me" and "mine" (e.g., a Paleolithic hunter's self-preservation) is universal, the *interpretation* of the self and human agency in its moral and spiritual dimensions varies significantly across cultures and history.
    *   Modern notions of "the self" (as a noun, with articles) and the "inner/outer" distinction are **historically local self-interpretations**, "strange and without precedent" in many other cultures.
    *   While a basic sense of "inner" (unexpressed thought) is common, different civilizations weave this into rich, unique "spiritual doctrines" (e.g., Geertz's Javanese "batin"/"lair"). The modern Western conception is distinct.

2.  **Plato's Moral Doctrine: Reason as the Moral Source (Section 6.1):**
    *   **Core Idea:** Plato's moral philosophy, particularly in the *Republic*, holds that we become good when reason ("the domain of thought") rules the soul, overcoming the chaotic and insatiable desires. This is "self-mastery."
    *   **Fruits of Rational Rule:** This hegemony of reason brings "unity with oneself, calm, and collected self-possession" (kosmos, xumphonia, harmonia), transforming the soul from inner "civil war" (stasis).
    *   **Historical Dominance:** Plato's view established a dominant family of moral theories in Western civilization, where reason is seen as both a power to see things aright and a condition of self-possession.
    *   **Ancient and Modern Challenges:**
        *   **Ancient Rivals:** Plato contended with alternative moralities, such as the "warrior ethic" (valuing strength, glory, action, often involving divine "mania" or "possession") and manic poetic inspiration. Plato aimed to discredit the latter and subordinate the former (identifying 'spirit' or 'thumos' as an auxiliary to reason).
        *   **Later Rebellions:** Christian thinkers (e.g., Luther's "reason as that whore"), Romantics, Nietzsche, and the Frankfurt School have challenged reason's hegemony, seeing rational control as potentially stifling or enslaving ("dialectic of Enlightenment").

3.  **Plato vs. Homeric Psychology and the Unity of Mind:**
    *   Taylor, drawing on Bruno Snell, contrasts Plato's view with Homeric psychology. Homeric heroes lack a single "mind" or "soul" (in the post-Platonic sense); instead, mental functions are fragmented and localized in different bodily parts (e.g., 'thumos' in the lungs, 'kradie' in the heart).
    *   **Divine Infusion:** Homeric heroes are often empowered or misguided by divine infusion, which *does not diminish* their merit or responsibility but is an inseparable part of their greatness.
    *   **Plato's Unitary Mind:** Plato's system, privileging self-collected rational awareness as the highest state, necessitates a conception of the mind as a **unitary space**. Special states (like rage or divine inspiration) are seen as "lapses," obstacles to be overcome, representing a "loss of centring." For Plato, the soul is *de jure* one; plurality of loci signifies error and imperfection. This unity is crucial for the morality of rational hegemony.

4.  **Plato's Precondition for Inwardness, Not Inwardness Itself (Section 6.2):**
    *   The unification of the moral self in Plato's theory is a **precondition** for the later development of the modern notion of "interiority," but it is not the internalization itself.
    *   While Plato prioritizes the "disposition of the soul" over "external success" (e.g., a just man is better off even in suffering), which *could* be framed as "internal vs. external," he **does not use this dichotomy**. His crucial oppositions are soul/body, immaterial/bodily, eternal/changing.
    *   Taylor notes that it is **Augustine** who first formulates a theory stressing soul goods over worldly action in terms of "inner and outer."
    *   **Plato's Substantive Reason and the Cosmic Order:** Plato's reason is a "substantive conception," tied to the perception of a natural and right order, analogous to health. This order is not merely internal to the soul but fundamentally connected to the **order of the cosmos and the Idea of the Good.**
    *   **The Good as External Moral Source:** The Good is the ultimate, external source of moral value, commanding categorical love and allegiance. The good life for humans involves perceiving and loving this eternal, cosmic order. Philosophy, as the love of eternal truth, is the safeguard of virtue because it leads to the vision and imitation of this unchanging Good.
    *   **Conclusion:** For Plato, moral sources are **not within us** but "outside us, in the Good." Our access to a higher moral condition occurs in the "space" between us and this external, cosmic order, contrasting sharply with the modern focus on immanent, internal moral sources that Taylor will explore further.

### Section 13

This section, continuing Taylor's historical tracing of "inwardness," bridges the gap from Plato's external moral sources to the radical interiority that shapes modern self-understanding, focusing on Augustine's pivotal role.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Plato's External Reason and Cosmic Order (Recap from Chapter 6):**
    *   Taylor reiterates that for Plato, reason is not an internalized capacity but the soul's ability to *perceive and turn towards an external, pre-existent cosmic order* illuminated by the Good. Education is a "periagoge" (turning around) of the entire soul, redirecting its gaze from the bodily and changing to the immaterial and eternal.
    *   Plato's crucial distinctions are soul/body, immaterial/bodily, eternal/changing; the "inner/outer" dichotomy is irrelevant for him, as the focus is on *what objects* the soul attends to in the metaphysical landscape. Reason is "substantive," inherently tied to a vision of this true order.

2.  **The Enduring Platonic Model in Antiquity (Section 6.3):**
    *   Plato's model of reason's rule by a *vision of rational order* remained dominant.
    *   **Aristotle** refined it, emphasizing "phronesis" (practical wisdom) for navigating changing particulars, distinct from the *theoria* (contemplation) of eternal cosmic order. However, both orders remain essential to the good life, and humans participate in a rational cosmic order through their nature.
    *   **The Stoics** rejected contemplation for its own sake, but their practical reason was still a *vision of order*, specifically the goodness of the whole cosmic order and divine providence, which liberates the sage. Physics was the ground of ethics.
    *   **Epicurus**, though denying cosmic rational order, still saw reason as the capacity to discern order—even if it was the lack of order (chance atoms) or a correct valuation of human pleasures.

3.  **Augustine's Breakthrough: The Introduction of Inwardness (Chapter 7):**
    *   Augustine, deeply influenced by Platonism (via Plotinus), synthesized these ideas with Christian theology, seeing God and the soul as immaterial and adopting Platonic dualities (spirit/flesh, eternal/temporal). The Ideas became God's eternal thoughts, and the universe was an external realization of God's rational order, demanding human love and respect.
    *   **The Crucial Shift: Emphasis on Love and the "Inner/Outer" Dichotomy:** While agreeing with Plato on the importance of the direction of attention, Augustine emphasizes *love* as the deciding factor (charity vs. concupiscence). More significantly, Augustine introduces and centralizes the **inner/outer distinction**, specifically to describe the path to God. The "inner man" (soul) is distinct from the "outer man" (bodily).
    *   **"In Interiore Homine Habitat Veritas":** For Augustine, the road to God and truth lies *within*: "Do not go outward; return within yourself. In the inward man dwells truth."

4.  **God as the "Inner Light" and the Birth of Radical Reflexivity:**
    *   Unlike Plato's Good, which illuminates external reality, Augustine's God is not just a transcendent object but also the *underlying principle of our knowing activity*—an "inner light" in the soul (linking Plato's metaphors to John's Gospel).
    *   This shifts the focus from the *objects known* to the *activity of knowing itself*, which is particular to each individual. This naturally leads to a *reflexive stance* and the language of inwardness.
    *   **Radical Reflexivity / First-Person Standpoint:** Taylor defines this as making the *fact of the world's being experienced* by me, or "what it is like to be an experiencing agent," the object of attention. This is distinct from earlier "care of self" (which focused on the soul's health as an object). Augustine's innovation was to make this radical reflexivity, with its *asymmetrical access* to one's own experience, crucial for accessing a higher spiritual condition.

5.  **The Augustinian "Proto-Cogito":**
    *   Augustine introduced this inwardness to the Western tradition, making the first-person standpoint fundamental for truth. This is evidenced in his "proto-cogito" argument in *On Free Will*, where he demonstrates that one cannot doubt one's own existence ("if you did not exist it would be impossible for you to be deceived"). This establishes a certainty *for me*, a "certainty of self-presence," as a foundational truth on the path back to God (as the higher, common standard for reason).
    *   Augustine thus sets the stage for future developments in Western thought (e.g., Descartes' epistemology), but his unique motivation was to provide a route to God through this inner, radically reflexive turn.

### Section 14

This section delves deeper into Augustine's concept of "inwardness," showing how it marks a pivotal shift from Plato's philosophy, and sets the stage for Descartes' revolutionary reinterpretation.

Here's a summary of the key points:

1.  **Augustine's Proof of God from Inner Experience:** Augustine argues for God's existence by reflecting on the first-person experience of knowing and reasoning. He posits that our minds rely on common, eternal, unchanging standards of truth (e.g., 7+3=10, or the superiority of the eternal), which are not our own product but superior to the human mind. This "truth" is accessible to all, unlike physical objects. Thus, by going inward into the act of knowing, one is drawn upward to a higher, common reality—God as Truth.

2.  **Motivation for Inwardness:** Augustine's primary concern wasn't to solve Cartesian-style skepticism (how to get beyond one's inner world), but to demonstrate that God is to be found at the very foundations of the person, in the "intimacy of self-presence." God gives us standards of right judgment not just through the external world of Ideas, but more fundamentally as an "incorporeal light" irradiating our minds from within.

3.  **Augustine's "Memory" and Implicit Knowledge:** He adapts Plato's concept of 'memory' (reminiscence) but severs its link to prenatal experience. For Augustine, "memoria" refers to a deep, implicit understanding of rational principles and our own nature, which is "within us" and guides us from self-ignorance to true self-knowledge. This prefigures the doctrine of innate ideas.

4.  **The Way Within Leads Above:** At the root of this "memory" and implicit understanding is God, the "Master within," the source of the inner light. The experience of being illumined from beyond oneself is fundamentally an experience of inwardness. In striving for self-presence, the soul ultimately finds God. This path is "leading from the exterior to the interior and from the interior to the superior," making the inward journey indispensable for reaching God. God is "closer to me than I am myself, while being infinitely above me" ("interior intimo meo et superior summo meo").

5.  **The Trinity in the Soul:** Augustine finds reflections of the Divine Trinity (mind, knowledge, love; or memory, intelligence, will) in the soul's capacity for self-knowledge and self-love. This process of the soul striving to perfect its self-presence and self-affirmation most clearly shows man as the image of God, tying radical reflexivity directly to one's relationship with God.

6.  **The Augustinian Will:**
    *   **Departure from Plato:** Unlike Plato, for whom desire for the good is a function of seeing it, Augustine introduces a developed notion of the will, which is not simply dependent on knowledge.
    *   **Stoic Influence:** He incorporates the Stoic idea of humans' power to give or withhold assent or choice (synkatathesis, prohairesis), making individual "moral choice" central.
    *   **Christian Outlook and Two Loves:** Crucially, Augustine's Christian perspective allows for two radically different moral dispositions—charity vs. concupiscence—where the will can be "radically perverse," turning its back even on the good it perceives (due to Adam's sin). This means the will must first be healed by grace.
    *   **Akrasia as Central Crisis:** Weakness of will ("akrasia"), a problem for Socratic theories, becomes the "central crisis of moral experience" for Augustine, explaining how we act against our better insight (St. Paul).
    *   **Evil and Reflexivity:** Evil is described as self-enclosed reflexivity, a drive to make oneself the center. Healing comes not from abandoning reflexivity, but from opening it to acknowledge dependence on God.
    *   **Gratuitous Love:** Both love and the refusal of love are seen as "gratuitous," leaping beyond a simple cosmos ordered for the Good, a core Judaeo-Christian insight.

7.  **Augustine's Legacy and Anticipation of Descartes:**
    *   **Hallowed Inwardness:** Augustine's doctrine hallows radical reflexivity as the "space" where we encounter God and effect moral transformation, laying the groundwork for Western spirituality's search for God within.
    *   **"Augustinian" Proofs:** His method of proving God's existence from internal perfections (eternal truth in thinking) anticipates Anselm's ontological argument and Descartes's proofs in the *Meditations*, which also start from the idea of perfection found within the mind.
    *   **Proto-Cogito and Innate Ideas:** Augustine used and commented on the word "cogito" (thinking as inner assembly) and had a germinal idea of "innate ideas" (memory as an imprint), further foreshadowing Cartesian thought.

8.  **Transition to Descartes: Internalized Moral Sources:**
    *   While Descartes is deeply Augustinian in his emphasis on reflexivity, the cogito, and internal proofs of God, he introduces a "radical twist."
    *   **Key Difference:** Descartes, unlike Augustine, *situates the moral sources within us*. Plato saw them externally in the cosmic order, Augustine saw an internal *path* to an external God, but Descartes brings about a "transposition" where "an important power has been internalized."
    *   **Rejection of Teleology:** This shift is linked to Descartes' rejection of Plato's teleological cosmic order and "ontic logos." His mechanistic universe and representational theory of knowledge (knowledge as a "correct picture within of outer reality") necessitate a new understanding of reason and morality, where the mind constructs its representation rather than perceiving a pre-existing order.

### Section 15

This section details Descartes's radical departure from earlier philosophical traditions, particularly Plato and Augustine, by internalizing moral sources and redefining knowledge, dualism, rational mastery, and virtue.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Knowledge as Construction, Not Discovery:**
    *   For Descartes, knowledge is *built* by the mind, not *found* in an external, pre-existent order (as for Plato).
    *   It's not enough for representations to match external reality; they must also carry *certainty* for the knower, achieved through "évidence" (clear and distinct perceptions).
    *   Reason constructs knowledge through methodical ordering and division of thoughts ("Regulae," "Discours"), leading to a chain of clear and distinct perceptions. The act of thinking ("cogitare") is fundamentally about gathering and ordering representations to meet subjective demands for certainty.

2.  **A Radically Different Dualism:**
    *   Descartes rejects Plato's "order of Ideas" and the notion that the soul turns towards supersensible realities. Instead, understanding physical reality in Platonic terms is a confusion to be overcome.
    *   Realizing one's immaterial nature involves perceiving the "ontological cleft" between soul and body and grasping the material world (including the body) as "mere extension," understood "mechanistically and functionally."
    *   This requires "disengaging from our usual embodied perspective" and "objectifying" the world, seeing it as "disenchanted"—devoid of spiritual essence or meaning, a "mere mechanism."
    *   While more austere than Plato's dualism (no spiritual in the bodily), it paradoxically *needs* the bodily: the soul frees itself not by turning away, but by *objectifying embodied experience* (an "innerworldly liberation").

3.  **New Model of Rational Mastery and "Masters of Nature":**
    *   Rational self-mastery no longer means attunement to a cosmic good (Plato/Stoics), but the capacity to *construct orders* that meet internal standards of knowledge and certainty (i.e., "evidence").
    *   Unlike the Stoics, for whom reason's hegemony was a vision of providential order, for Descartes, it means reason *controls and instrumentalizes* desires.
    *   Descartes's "physics" grounds his ethics by revealing the "utter separation of mind from a mechanistic universe." This "disenchantment" or "neutralization of the cosmos" allows us to grasp the world as a domain of *potential instrumental control*.
    *   The goal is to become "masters and possessors of Nature" through knowledge leading to control. Rational mastery is defined by instrumental control, where reason acts as a "directing agency subordinating a functional domain."

4.  **A Functional Theory of Passions:**
    *   Descartes rejects the Stoic idea that passions are simply "wrong opinions." Instead, he views them as "functional devices" designed by the Creator to help preserve the body-soul union and strengthen responses useful for the organism's survival or well-being (e.g., fear for flight).
    *   Reason's role is not to eliminate passions, but to hold them to their "normal instrumental function." Strong passions are not problematic; in fact, the stronger they are, the more useful they can be, provided reason "steers" them.
    *   This leads to an emphasis on "strength, firmness, resolution, control" of the will to direct actions effectively.

5.  **Internalization of Moral Sources and "Générosité":**
    *   The shift to rational control means moral sources are no longer external (Plato's cosmic order, Stoic providence, Augustine's external God accessible inwardly), but *internal* to the agent.
    *   Moral strength derives from the individual's "sense of his own dignity as a rational being," anticipating Kant's emphasis on human dignity.
    *   The central virtue becomes **"générosité" (generosity)**, but it's fundamentally transformed. Unlike the traditional honour ethic (concerned with public fame), Cartesian generosity is an *internalized* sense of self-worth and honour that motivates the inner domination of passion by thought.
    *   This "strength of will" and "firmness of judgment" in controlling one's inner life is the new "motor of virtue."

### Section 16

This section elaborates on Descartes's moral philosophy, particularly his concept of "générosité," and then transitions to Locke, introducing the "punctual self" as a further development of disengagement and objectification, driven by an anti-teleological view.

Here's a concise summary:

1.  **Cartesian "Générosité" and Internalized Morality:**
    *   Descartes defines "générosité" (generosity) as a man's legitimate self-esteem, based on recognizing his free will as his only true possession and resolving to use it well ("never to fail... to undertake and execute all the things which he judges to be the best"). This perfect adherence to virtue makes dignity and self-esteem central to his moral vision.
    *   It functions as "the key of all other virtues, and a general remedy for all the disorders of the passions," replacing virtues like temperance in its pivotal role.

2.  **Disengaged Reason: Procedural vs. Substantive:**
    *   Descartes's ethic, like his epistemology, demands **disengagement from the world and body**, adopting an **instrumental stance**.
    *   Rational self-mastery is no longer about attuning to a cosmic order (Plato), but about *constructing* internal orders and "firm and determined judgments concerning the knowledge of good and evil."
    *   Conformity to the world's dispositions or human nature is strategic for maintaining rational control, *not* because these dispositions intrinsically command love or set the measure of rationality.
    *   Rationality is now **procedural** (thinking according to certain canons), focused on the *activity* of thinking, rather than **substantive** (being right about the order of being). While Descartes believes his procedure leads to truth, it's not defined by it (e.g., malicious demon hypothesis), establishing rationality as an *internal property of subjective thinking*.

3.  **Cartesian vs. Augustinian Inwardness – A Transposition:**
    *   While rooted in Augustinian inwardness and reflexivity, Descartes's project fundamentally *transposes* it.
    *   Augustine's inward path leads *upward* to God, revealing human dependence and lack of self-sufficiency.
    *   Descartes's reflexive turn aims for **self-sufficient certainty** (e.g., the cogito), which the individual can *generate for himself*.
    *   God's existence, for Descartes, becomes a *theorem* in his system of science, an inference from well-understood human powers, rather than an encounter with God at the roots of the self. This shift in the "centre of gravity" "opens the road to Deism," by making God a guarantor for human-generated certainty rather than the primary object of internal search.

4.  **The Punctual Self and Deeper Objectification (Transition to Locke):**
    *   Descartes's disengaged subject and procedural rationality are central to modern thought, building on **Neo-Stoicism** and a broader movement toward **methodical discipline and instrumental control** in society (military, absolutist state, as analyzed by Foucault). The ideal is an agent who can *remake himself* by taking an instrumental stance towards his own properties.
    *   The "punctual self" (developed through Locke and the Enlightenment) gains control through further **disengagement and objectification**.
    *   **Objectification** means depriving a domain (like the old cosmic order, or "ontic logos" embodying Reason/Goodness) of its normative force by adopting a neutral, instrumental stance. The mechanization of the scientific world-picture was a key example, partly driven by a theological anti-teleology (nominalism affirming God's absolute sovereignty by fiat).
    *   The punctual self extends this objectification to the *subject himself*. Descartes's treatment of secondary qualities and bodily sensations as "ideas in the mind" (rather than in external objects or the body) exemplifies this: it requires *withdrawing from normal, embodied experience* and treating it as an *object* (a "mere idea") caused by external mechanisms, thereby suspending its "intentional" dimension.
    *   This disengagement is a form of **radical reflexivity** employed to gain control over experience by fixing it and stripping it of its power to mislead.
    *   The author contrasts this with "engaged exploration" (e.g., attending more closely to feelings to understand them), highlighting that disengagement isn't the only path to knowledge.

5.  **Locke's Radical Anti-Teleology and Rejection of Innate Ideas:**
    *   Locke takes an uncompromising stance, defining the punctual self for the Enlightenment. He rejects all forms of **innate ideas** (going beyond Descartes), not just for epistemological reasons but due to a **profoundly anti-teleological view of human nature**.
    *   He argues against any notion that humans are naturally "attuned to the truth" or have an inherent "bent to the good" (whether ancient or modern).
    *   Locke dismisses "Universal Rationes" (like Cudworth's idea of active, innate mental energy generating truth) as "gratuitous syntheses," unfounded by reason, stressing that our conceptions are built from sensation and reflection, often without good grounds due to passion, custom, and education.

### Section 17

Locke extends Cartesian disengagement to an unprecedented degree, embarking on a radical **demolition project** to clear away custom, authority, and innate ideas. He posits a mind that is **"merely passive"** in receiving simple ideas (from sensation and reflection), rejecting any inherent "bent towards reason" or innate principles.

His theory of mind is deeply **mechanistic and atomistic**, treating simple ideas as "building blocks" passively imprinted by "insensible particles" and assembled into complex ideas through quasi-mechanical "association." This reifies ideas into inert objects, leading to conceptual difficulties.

Locke's aim is **self-responsibility** and **procedural reason**. Knowledge is only genuine if an individual "thinks it out themselves," engaging in a **radically reflexive** process of scrutinizing their own beliefs and syntheses. This disengaged reason is procedural (focused on the *process* of thinking according to canons, not substantive content) and **intransigently exclusive of authority**, viewing reliance on others' opinions as "slavery of the understanding."

He applies this **anti-teleological** view to morality, rejecting innate moral tendencies. Motivation is driven by **hedonism**, where pleasure and pain are good and evil. However, what *immediately* moves the will is not the good itself, but "uneasiness" (desire for an absent good), explained by a quasi-mechanical principle precluding "action at a distance."

Despite this, Locke introduces the **will's power to "suspend" desires**, allowing rational examination of goods and the **remaking of one's "relish" (habits/preferences)** to align with what conduces to happiness and God's law. This opens the prospect of radical **self-remaking**, where habits are instrumentally rather than naturally formed.

This self-remaking power defines the **"Punctual Self"**: an "extensionless" agent identified solely with the power to objectify and remake its own particular features. Locke roots personal identity not in substance, but in **consciousness** that can "unite existences and actions" across time, though the text critiques the illusion of a perfectly detachable consciousness. He sees the "person" as a "forensic term," linking identity to moral accountability for acts.

Locke's philosophy was immensely influential in the Enlightenment, providing a plausible account of new science, rational self-control, and **self-responsibility**, thereby rationalizing and strengthening widespread **disciplinary practices** of self-control. His model of the **disengaged, instrumental ego** permeates modern psychology. The modern "self" and its reflexive expressions ("I," "ego") arise from this radical **self-objectification** and separation from our given nature, leading to the ongoing philosophical paradox of the objectifying subject's "ungrounded," "extra-worldly" status.

### Section 18

This section delves deeper into the nature of the modern "self" and its inherent "radical reflexivity," contrasting it with ancient views and exploring two key strands of its formation:

1.  **The Paradox of Modern Selfhood:** The modern human is viewed from a "third-person perspective" (radical objectivity), yet this is based on a "first-person stance" (radical subjectivity), creating a fundamental paradox (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty). Unlike ancient injunctions to "take care of yourself," the modern turn inward is a "radical reflexivity"—a turn to the self *as a self* in the first-person, deeply embedded in our language and understanding.

2.  **Two Strands of Internalization:**
    *   **Disengagement & Self-Responsibility (Cartesian/Lockean):** One strand, originating with Descartes and intensified by Locke's "punctual self," emphasizes disengagement and an instrumental stance towards oneself. This cultivates an ideal of "self-responsibility" and redefines freedom and reason, transforming individuals to accept this as normal and natural.
    *   **Self-Exploration & Particularity (Augustinian/Montaigne):** Another strand, rooted in Augustine's inward turn, generates secularized forms of self-exploration. Montaigne is a pivotal figure here:
        *   **Rejection of Universal Nature:** Unlike the ancient quest for a stable, universal human nature, Montaigne, experiencing "terrifying inner instability," embarked on observing and cataloguing his *own* changing thoughts and feelings.
        *   **Acceptance of Flux:** He embraced the "mutability of all things" ("Le monde n’est qu’une branloire perenne") and sought an equilibrium by identifying his unique "maistresse forme"—his particular way of living in flux.
        *   **Individualized Nature:** For Montaigne, following "nature" means conforming to *one's own* specific condition, not a universal model. He advocated for living within personal limits, eschewing "superhuman spiritual aspirations" and integrating the "marvelously corporall" human condition.
        *   **Montaigne vs. Descartes:** While both involve inward turns, Montaigne's aim is to identify the individual's "unrepeatable difference" (originality) through a "deeper engagement in our particularity," in contrast to Descartes's search for universal, generalizable knowledge through "radical disengagement." Montaigne's self-study is intensely individual, first-person, and aims to "decipher myself," leading to a self that is "made" by its own expression.
        *   **Legacy:** Montaigne pioneered the modern "search for the self" to "come to terms with oneself," a fundamental theme that shapes our understanding of "identity" as a unique question about "me" that universal doctrines cannot fully answer.
    *   **Protestant Introspection:** Augustinian self-examination also manifested in Puritan and Jesuit disciplines, encouraging constant inner scrutiny for signs of grace. This Protestant introspection later secularized into confessional autobiographies (e.g., Rousseau) and influenced the development of the English novel.

3.  **Three-Sided Individualism and Localization:**
    *   By the 18th century, the modern self emerges, integrating: 1) self-responsible independence (from disengagement), 2) recognized particularity (from self-exploration), and 3) **personal commitment** (from the Stoic/Augustinian/Protestant emphasis on the "whole will" and total commitment for all).
    *   This complex self-sense creates the "illusion of being anchored in our very being."
    *   **Shift in "Localization":** A crucial development is the confinement of "thought and feeling—the psychological—to minds." In pre-modern thought (e.g., Plato, Aristotle), ideas and valuations were seen as "ontically situated"—located *in the world* or cosmos, not solely within the subject. Knowledge was seen as a continuity between the activity of the object and the percipient sense. With disengagement and disenchantment, the "gap between subject and object" becomes distinct, and mental properties are localized "in" the mind, rather than straddling this division.

### Section 19

This section delves into the profound shift in the "localization" of thought, valuation, and the nature of things from a pre-modern to a modern worldview, stemming from disengagement and disenchantment.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Shift in Localization of Thought and Value:**
    *   **Pre-modern (Ontic Logos):** In the traditional view, significance and value (e.g., the praiseworthiness of things, the glory of God) were seen as inherently residing *in the object* or the world itself, connecting knower and known. There was a fuzzy boundary between the psychic and physical.
    *   **Modern (Disengagement):** With disengagement, the concept of ontic logos ceases to be meaningful. Valuations and ideas are now unambiguously localized *in minds* (ours or God's), not in the objects themselves. This creates a new, strong sense of the "psychic" as an exclusive domain of the mind.

2.  **New Understanding of Subject and Object:**
    *   This strong localization leads to the modern conception of "subject" and "object" as distinct, separable entities (e.g., Descartes's idea of minds without bodies). In contrast, older views (like Aristotle's *nous*) saw them as inseparably linked within a larger order.
    *   Heidegger's term "new subjectivism" describes this shift, where what was formerly *between* knower/agent and world is now placed *within* the subject.

3.  **Sharp Boundary Between Psychic and Physical:**
    *   The modern worldview necessitates a clear, fixed boundary between the psychic and the physical, making concepts like "psycho-physical correlations" possible.
    *   **Example of Melancholy:** In the older humoral theory, "black bile *is* melancholy" (the substance embodies the significance). In the modern view, melancholy feelings are *in the mind*, and black bile merely *causes* them through a psycho-physical link. This dualism becomes the default, placing the "onus of argument" on those who seek to overcome it.

4.  **Localization of "Nature" in Things:**
    *   **Pre-modern (Aristotelian Forms):** The "nature" or "Form" of a thing was seen as prior to and not ontically dependent on particular instances; it existed within an order of Forms.
    *   **Modern (Nominalist):** The "nature" of a thing (its causal properties) is localized *within* the particular entity and is entirely dependent on its existence. If the particulars disappear, so does its "nature." This is a "profoundly nominalist conception" where a thing's nature is not defined by its place in a larger whole.

5.  **Consequences: Decline of Magic and the Witchcraft Craze:**
    *   The pre-modern "open boundary" between psychic and physical made belief in magic (powers residing in substances or speech acts) coherent.
    *   The **Protestant Reformation** significantly contributed to the "disenchantment" of the world, seeing magic as an illegitimate attempt to control divine power and even assimilating Catholic sacraments to magic.
    *   The **European witchcraft craze (15th-17th C)** is reinterpreted as a "crisis in transition," reflecting the anxiety and fragility of the emerging modern identity as it broke from a world of embedded meaning and faced the perceived threat of a "thraldom" that challenged the nascent sense of self-possession.

6.  **Rise of Political Atomism and Social Contract Theories:**
    *   The disengaged subject, with purposes found *within*, combined with the new localization of nature, fostered a notion of **individual independence**.
    *   **17th-Century Innovation:** Social contract theories (Grotius, Pufendorf, Locke) introduced a "contract of association" that *preceded* the contract of government, explaining how a community could even form from individuals seen as "political atoms" who are "by nature" not bound to any authority.
    *   **Personal Commitment (Puritanism):** The Calvinist/Puritan emphasis on individual "willed consent" and personal commitment (even breaking from "natural" communities) strongly reinforced the idea that only individual consent could create legitimate authority, influencing contractual understandings of society and marriage.
    *   **Divine Right of Kings:** This was also a *modern* atomist doctrine, assuming no natural authority and arguing for specific divine intervention to establish royal power to prevent anarchy.
    *   **Legacy:** Modern society still defaults to an atomist-instrumental view of politics (society as a creation of will or an instrument to individual ends) and frames rights in terms of subjective, autonomous individuals (Locke's "possessive individualism").
    *   **Continuing Tension:** While "civic humanist" counter-ideas exist (society as a matrix that shapes individuals), they struggle against the "naturally favoured" and persistently plausible atomist-instrumental perspective in modern political thought and practice.

### Section 20

This section introduces a third key feature of the modern identity: **"poietic powers"**—the new centrality of constructed orders and artifacts in mental and moral life.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Poietic Powers in Modern Identity:** Beyond the characteristic localizations and atomism discussed previously, the modern self emphasizes its *constructive* or *productive* capacities.
2.  **Manifestations in Thought and Morality:**
    *   **Knowledge:** Rooted in Descartes and developed by empiricists like Hobbes and Locke, knowledge is seen as *constructed*—framing a representation of reality using "building blocks" of sensations and ideas, rather than merely finding a pre-existing order. Certainty arises from reflecting on thinking as an activity we perform.
    *   **Self-Remaking:** In the moral domain, Locke portrays the "punctual self" as the *constructor of its own character*, undertaking a task of self-remaking rather than simply following a natural telos.
    *   **Language:** Hobbes and Locke view language nominally, with words arbitrarily defined to *aid the construction of thought* and enable genuine knowledge by combining ideas. This leads to a strong emphasis on mastering and marshalling thoughts, with a corresponding anxiety about words becoming unmoored from experience.
    *   **Expressive Revolution (Late 18th Century):** This develops further as language and representational powers are seen not just for portraying reality, but for *manifesting and expressing what we are*, leading to *self-completion*. This exalts the "creative imagination" as a central poietic power, increasing its importance in human life.
3.  **Digression on Historical Explanation:**
    *   The author clarifies that his study is *interpretive*, focusing on the "idées-forces" (the appeal, conviction, and spiritual power) of the modern identity. It is *not* a comprehensive "diachronic-causal" historical explanation of *how* the identity arose, acknowledging that such an account would require addressing institutional, economic, political, and military changes far beyond the scope of his current work.
    *   He rejects a simplistic "idealist" view that subordinates all structural changes to ideas, while also criticizing reductive Marxist accounts that neglect the intrinsic power of ideas.
    *   He provides examples like Pico della Mirandola's *Oration* and Renaissance art to illustrate how earlier cultural developments *prepared the way* for the modern identity, particularly noting how Renaissance art's use of perspective fostered a new *distance and separation between subject and object*, mirroring the disengagement of the modern self.
4.  **Ideas and Practices – Reciprocal Causation:**
    *   The author posits that ideas (moral ideals, self-understandings) are deeply *embedded in practices* (shared activities like religious rituals, political processes, family life, markets).
    *   Ideas often articulate the rationale of practices, but practices also shape and influence ideas, in a constant, complex, and "inextricable skein of causes."
    *   The causal balance can shift over time: initially, ideas might facilitate practices (e.g., possessive individualism aiding market relations), but later, practices (e.g., industrialization) can impose certain self-understandings. The global spread of modern practices (science, military, capitalism) through their success further reinforces associated self-understandings.
5.  **Study's Continued Focus:** The author reaffirms his commitment to the *interpretive question*—articulating the modern identity's phases and its spiritual appeal—while constantly bearing in mind the broader context of practices and the powerful historical forces shaping them, even if they are not the primary focus.

### Section 21

This section, "The Affirmation of Ordinary Life," introduces a second major aspect of the modern identity, crucial for understanding our sense of "inner depths."

**Key Points:**

1.  **Definition of "Ordinary Life":** The author defines "ordinary life" as encompassing human activities related to **production and reproduction**: labor, making things, marriage, and family.

2.  **Reversal of Traditional Hierarchies:**
    *   **Pre-Modern View:** Traditionally (Aristotle, Stoics, Plato, scholarly humanism, civic humanism, aristocratic ethic), ordinary life was considered *subordinate* or merely *infrastructural* to "higher" activities like theoretical contemplation, civic participation, or the pursuit of honor/glory. Life dedicated solely to production/reproduction was seen as less than fully human.
    *   **Modern Shift:** The transition involves upsetting these hierarchies, placing the **locus of the good life *within* "life" itself**—specifically, within labor and production, and marriage and family life.

3.  **Critique of "Higher" Activities:**
    *   **Contemplation (Theoria):** Francis Bacon vigorously criticized the traditional ideal of grasping cosmic order through contemplation, deeming it "vain and misguided" and "without fruit." He argued that true knowledge is demonstrated by its "operation" and ability to "relieve and benefit the condition of man," exalting the artisan over the philosopher. He attributed the old science's error to pride, "prescribing laws to nature" rather than discovering God's seal on things.
    *   **Honor and Glory:** The aristocratic ethic of honor was subjected to "withering critique" in the 17th century (Hobbes, Pascal, Molière), denounced as "vainglory" and "undisciplined self-indulgence." This was replaced by the "bourgeois" ideal of **"doux commerce"** (Hirschman), which saw trade and acquisition as constructive, civilizing forces promoting peace and "polished mores," in contrast to destructive military glory.

4.  **Consequences of the Shift:**
    *   **Social Levelling:** The affirmation of ordinary life inherently promotes social levelling, as the good life becomes accessible to everyone, not just a leisured few.
    *   **Liberal Society:** This shift profoundly influenced the development of modern liberal society with its ideals of equality, universal rights, the work ethic, and the exaltation of sexual love and family life. It also shaped revolutionary thought, exalting man as a producer.

5.  **Sources of the Affirmation – The Reformation's Role:**
    *   **Judaeo-Christian Spirituality:** The ultimate origin is the Judaeo-Christian insight that God as creator affirms life and being ("God saw that it was good").
    *   **The Protestant Reformation (Key Impetus):** The Reformers provided the specific impetus for this modern affirmation by:
        *   **Rejecting Mediation:** Denying a hierarchy of devotion or the ability of some (e.g., saints, priests) to mediate salvation; emphasizing total, personal commitment directly to God.
        *   **Salvation Exclusively God's Work:** Stressing humanity's utter helplessness and depravity, highlighting God's sole power and mercy in salvation, leading to faith as an acknowledgement of this gift.
        *   **Rejection of the Catholic Sacred:** Denouncing Catholic sacraments (especially the Mass) and the idea of special holy places, times, or actions as "presumptuous" attempts to "fetter God’s unlimited sovereignty."
        *   **Individual Stance Before God:** Each person stands alone in relation to God; there is no "common movement carrying humans to salvation" (no "ecclesial ship," but rather "each believer rows his or her own boat").
        *   **Enhanced Status for "Profane" Life:** Repudiating special monastic vocations, which were seen as implying a hierarchy of spiritual status and a "slur" on the spiritual standing of productive labor and family life. This affirmed the **"Priesthood of all believers"** and the spiritual value of **lay life**, denying the sharp distinction between sacred and profane.

6.  **Christian vs. Stoic Renunciation:**
    *   The author distinguishes Christian martyrdom (giving up a *good* for God, thereby *affirming* its intrinsic value; characterized by struggle and loss, as with Jesus's agony) from Stoic renunciation (giving up something considered *without value*; characterized by serenity, as with Socrates's death).
    *   Christian loss is seen as a "breach" in the integrity of the good, necessitating an eschatological restoration.

7.  **Critique of Fusions with Pagan Philosophy:**
    *   The author notes how early Christian thought (e.g., Augustine) fused with Platonic ideas (like the Good, order of Ideas), creating syntheses that, while influential, also led to tensions.
    *   These fusions often reintroduced hierarchical notions (e.g., aligning Pauline spirit/flesh with Platonic immaterial/bodily) that implicitly devalued ordinary life and credited "higher" ascetic vocations, precisely what the Reformers rebelled against.

### Section 22

This section elaborates on how the **Protestant Reformation, particularly Puritanism**, significantly deepened the "affirmation of ordinary life" discussed previously, profoundly shaping modern identity and culture.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Hallowing of Mundane Life:** The Reformation allowed for the potentiality of conceiving the "hallowing of life" not just at its extremes (e.g., monasticism, martyrdom), but as a spiritual transformation that could "penetrate the full extent of mundane life." This idea, previously seen in Rabbinic Judaism, was unprecedentedly extended in Christendom by the Reformers.

2.  **Anti-Hierarchical Influence:** This spiritual development naturally dovetailed with the anti-hierarchical aspects of the gospel, discrediting traditional notions of superior vocations or social castes and elevating the spiritual status of everyday activities.

3.  **Ordinary Life for God's Glory ("Innerworldly Asceticism"):**
    *   **Augustinian Principle:** Drawing from Augustine, Puritan thought emphasized that while God created the world for human use, humanity's sin led to desiring things as ends in themselves, disrupting the divine order.
    *   **Regeneration's Role:** Grace restores this order, but this doesn't mean traditional ascetic renunciation. Instead, humans are to **enjoy God's gifts (things of the world, marriage) with a specific spirit: detached yet worshipful use.**
    *   **Two Errors to Avoid:** Puritans cautioned against the "monkish error" of renouncing God's gifts (seen as prideful and scorning creation) and the error of becoming absorbed in things, loving them as ultimate ends rather than instruments for God's glory.
    *   **"Weaned Affections":** This led to the concept of "innerworldly asceticism" (Weber), where one is diligent in worldly affairs but detached in spirit, using the world "as if you used them not"—the only way to restore the right order.

4.  **The Sanctification of the Calling (Labor):**
    *   **Spiritual Significance:** All labor, however humble, became a "calling" (vocation) from God, equally valued if it was useful to mankind and served God's purposes. This radically challenged the traditional hierarchy of vocations.
    *   **"God Loveth Adverbs":** The crucial factor was the *spirit* in which an activity was performed, not the activity itself. Performing even mundane tasks (like "washing dishes") with obedience and conscience was as spiritually worthy as preaching.
    *   **Work as Sanctification:** Labor was a serious, earnest, and unremitting spiritual duty, a primary means through which sanctification occurred, and a bulwark against idleness and temptation.
    *   **Purpose:** The aim was to "serve God in the serving of men in the works of our callings," benefiting the "common good" rather than solely seeking personal gain or honor.
    *   **Influence on Capitalism:** This disciplined, rationalized work ethic, coupled with frugality, is identified as a **formative influence on modern capitalist culture**, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world (connecting to Weber's thesis).

5.  **The Sanctification of Marriage:**
    *   **Rehabilitation:** The Reformers elevated marriage, and Puritanism emphasized its intrinsic spiritual value, promoting mutual love, companionship, and support as God's will.
    *   **Detachment:** However, this marital love, too, must not become an end in itself or compete with the love of God. Affections needed to be moderated and detached, serving to bring spouses "nearer to God."
    *   **Influence on Modern Culture:** This contributed to the ideal of **companionate marriage**, ancestral to contemporary understandings of marriage and sexual love.

6.  **Calvinist/Puritan Activism:**
    *   **Militant Drive:** Calvinism (especially Puritanism) exhibited a distinctive "militant activism" to reorganize the church and the world, contrasting with Lutheranism's more internal focus.
    *   **Repairing Disorder:** This activism was not aimed at earning salvation (which was by faith and predestination), but rather **a regenerate person's imperative to repair the world's disorder and sin, which "continuously stinks in God's nostrils."**
    *   **Revolutionary Energy:** This motive fueled revolutionary movements, civil wars, and social regulation, seeking personal discipline and a social order based on "settled courses" and mutual reliability.
    *   **Contractual Society:** It fostered the idea of society based on freely agreed contracts among self-disciplined individuals, though initially aiming for elite rule of the godly over the unregenerate.
    *   **Affinity with Ancient Israel:** Paradoxically, Puritans strongly identified with ancient Israel, viewing themselves as a people constituted by God's law, tasked with rectifying worldly disorder, seeing the law not for salvation but for divine order.

7.  **Support for the Scientific Revolution:**
    *   **Hospitable Environment:** Puritan theology fostered a "hospitable environment" for Baconian science.
    *   **Shared Principles:** Both movements rebelled against traditional authority (e.g., Aristotle), advocating a return to neglected sources (Scriptures vs. experimental reality) and "living experience" over "dead received doctrine."
    *   **Benefiting Mankind:** The Puritan emphasis on serving the common good through practical action aligned with Bacon's vision of science serving to "benefit mankind" rather than merely speculative knowledge.
    *   **Social Base:** The new science appealed to the "middling sort" (artisans, tradesmen, small landholders) who were developing new confidence and self-reliance, mirroring the new theology.

In essence, the text argues that Puritanism's radical reinterpretation of Christian faith led to a powerful embrace of the spiritual significance of everyday life, work, and marriage, which in turn significantly contributed to the emergence of modern capitalism's work ethic, revolutionary political activism, and the scientific revolution.

### Section 23

This section elaborates on the profound connection between **Puritanism and the Scientific Revolution**, then introduces how the "affirmation of ordinary life" converged with rational thought in figures like John Locke, forming "Rationalized Christianity."

**Key Points from Section 23 (pages 231-233): The Spiritualization of the Instrumental Stance**

1.  **Convergence of New Science, Religion, and Revolutionary Spirit:** Social changes driven by the new religion of personal commitment created a receptive audience for Baconian science. The Baconian shift from theoretical contemplation to **productive efficacy** aligned with a social valuation favoring "productive artisan classes" over leisure-focused aristocrats, elevating the status of "getting one's hands dirty." This fueled the revolutionary spirit in 17th-century England.
2.  **Deeper, Lasting Connection: Biblical Stewardship:** Beyond temporal convergence, a more lasting link exists through the religious outlook of Puritanism. Bacon's science, though secular in application, was implicitly rooted in a biblical understanding of humans as **stewards of God's creation**.
3.  **Science as Pious Purpose:**
    *   **"Epistemically Correct" = "Spiritually Correct":** The "circumspect and sober use of things" (the "spiritually correct way") became essential to the "epistemically correct way" as well. Science's validity is tested by its *use* and requires responsible application.
    *   **Search for God's Purposes:** Baconian science gained a pious purpose: not only to benefit mankind (a proper calling) but also as a **search for God's purposes in creation**. Understanding these purposes brings greater glory to God and enables fitting praise for His design.
4.  **Spiritual Meaning of the Instrumental Stance:** This perspective imbued the instrumental approach to the world with significant spiritual meaning:
    *   It is the necessary stance for **working in one's calling** to preserve oneself and God's order.
    *   It **protects against absorption in things**, preventing them from becoming ends in themselves and thus distracting from God (e.g., Sibbes: "use [the world] as a servant... not as a Master"). Instrumentalizing things is spiritually essential.
5.  **"Overdetermined" Importance of Instrumental Stance:** Its central role in modern culture stems from a convergence of the new science, the dignity of disengaged rational control, and the theologically-rooted ethic of ordinary life (which values efficacious control for preservation/enhancement and detachment from purely personal enjoyments).
6.  **Demise of Old "Ontic Logos":** Puritanism contributed to the decline of traditional, meaningful orders based on an inherent "logos." Even if Platonic ideas (God ordering by Ideas) persisted (e.g., in New England via Ramus), they were transformed: "technologia" (grasping order as interlocking actions) and "eupraxia" (coherence of occasions for action) replaced contemplation of a static hierarchy. This laid groundwork for pragmatism.

**Key Points from Section 14 (pages 234-242): Rationalized Christianity and Locke's Synthesis**

1.  **Fusion of Ethics and Rationality:** This chapter traces how the **affirmation of ordinary life** fused with the philosophy of **disengaged freedom and rationality** (especially Descartes), giving rise to "Rationalized Christianity" and shaping modern identity. This shared an "instrumental stance" against older hierarchical views.
2.  **Dominant Modern Outlook:** This fusion, originating in England, became the dominant outlook of modern Western technological society, profoundly influencing modern culture and moral ideals.
3.  **John Locke as a Crucial Figure:** Locke is presented as a pivotal figure embodying this synthesis. He was a major articulator of disengaged freedom, yet a deeply believing Christian significantly influenced by the Puritan affirmation of ordinary life. The author argues against viewing Locke's faith as merely residual or protective.
4.  **Locke's Unique Theological-Moral Framework:**
    *   **Theological Voluntarism:** For Locke, moral good and obligation are founded in **God's commands**, not inherent natural bent (contrasting with Thomistic-Aristotelian views).
    *   **Reconciling Reason and Command:** He reconciles this with reason by arguing that humans can "read God's purposes" (especially preservation) from creation, making God's law rationally discernible.
    *   **Amalgam of Voluntarism and Hedonism:** Locke links divine commands to human reason through hedonism: good is pleasure, evil is pain. God's law is to be followed due to the promise of "superlative rewards and punishments." A law, to bind rational creatures, *must* be attended by penalties.
    *   **Instrumental Rationality of Obedience:** Obeying God is the instrumentally rational choice, as no other pain or pleasure can compare.
5.  **God as Benefactor in a Fallen World:**
    *   **Human Imperfection:** Locke believed that while humans are potentially rational, they have an innate "penchant to egocentricity and personal power" (a "naturalized variant" of original sin), laziness, and pride, preventing them from consistently obeying the Law of Nature through reason alone.
    *   **God's Intervention:** God's revelation (e.g., through Christ's miracles) makes His law unmistakably known and provides overwhelming **motivational force** (rewards/punishments) that humans lack on their own. God's mercy also means salvation is offered through faith, repentance, and sincere effort, not perfect compliance.
    *   **Order and Hope:** From this perspective, God is a great benefactor who lifts humanity out of self-destruction and despair, providing sense and hope to human life. This explains Locke's intolerance of atheists, whom he saw as undermining the very basis of civil society.
6.  **Law of Nature: Preservation, Industriousness, Common Good:**
    *   **Preservation as Central:** God's primary intent is human preservation, giving dignity and importance to productive activity.
    *   **"Industrious and Rational":** Locke integrates the Puritan "calling," emphasizing the duty to work hard and "efficaciously" (intellectual rationality) for one's own needs and the **common good**. This "improvement" (e.g., in agriculture) justifies private property by increasing overall human well-being.
    *   **"Bourgeois" Ideal:** Locke's vision reconciles self-service with beneficence through productive labor, contributing to the "harmony of interests" and laying groundwork for the modern "bourgeois" naturalist ethic. He continues the inversion of traditional aristocratic values, praising the "productive improver" over the pursuit of honor and glory.

### Section 24

This section deepens the analysis of **Locke's "Rationalized Christianity,"** detailing its understanding of human nature and God's design, and then introduces a **rival form of Deism** championed by Shaftesbury.

**I. Locke's Refined Theological-Moral Framework (Continuation of Section 23):**

1.  **Self-Love and Divine Design:** Locke distinguishes between irrational/destructive and rational/moral self-love. While recognizing humanity's "innate sources of depravity," he posits that basic self-love (fear of pain, desire for joy) is good and divinely ordained. God's providential design instrumentalizes human instrumental reason, aligning our pursuit of pleasure with His purpose of general conservation.
2.  **Transposition of "Theology of Ordinary Life":** Locke's acceptance of human nature's limitations, particularly the natural drive to maximize pleasure (Gassendian hedonism), mirrors the Reformation's rejection of "counsels of perfection" (monasticism, prideful attempts to transcend ordinary life). Humans should humbly accept their God-given nature and fulfill His purpose within it. This marks a shift from living "worshipfully for God" (Puritan emphasis) to living "rationally" for God.
3.  **Centrality of Instrumental Rationality:**
    *   **Moral & Intellectual:** Locke links moral and intellectual rationality through the primacy of instrumental, maximizing reason. This is God's "point of purchase" within us to elevate us.
    *   **Purpose:** The proper end of intellectual rationality is "usefulness to our life-purposes" (e.g., Locke's *Essay* aims for "Truth and Usefulness"). He emphasizes employing our minds for what is "of use to us."
    *   **Procedural Reason:** Locke's reason is procedural (instrumental in practice, careful scrutiny and empirical probability in theory) rather than substantive (seeing inherent order, culminating in contemplation). Through this procedural reason, we participate in God's purposes.
4.  **"Reasonable Religion" and God's Design:** Locke's "reasonable" religion is not egoistic but a new understanding of serving God. God's goodness and wisdom are seen in His design of a universe contrived for the "continued conservation of its animate and rational inhabitants," with the "preservation of ordinary life" taking prime importance. Eternal life is "superadded" but serves to reinforce earthly order through rewards and punishments.
5.  **Deist Vision:** Locke helped shape the Deist view of the universe as a vast, interlocking order of beings, mutually subserving each other's flourishing. Humans, in recognizing God's overwhelming power and rationally aligning with His law, do so not out of servile fear but with "admiration, wonder and gratitude," seeing instrumental rationality as their "avenue of participation" in God's will.
6.  **Integration of Modernity:** Lockean Deism integrates modern concepts of disengagement, procedural rationality, and "self-responsible autonomy," viewing God's purposes as fully respecting human autonomous reason.
7.  **Jettisoning Traditional Elements:**
    *   **Shrinking Mystery:** The place of mystery in religion diminishes as God's providence becomes more "scrutable" and rationally transparent.
    *   **Disappearance of Grace:** More fundamentally, the role of traditional grace tends to disappear. While Locke himself retained vestiges of hyper-Augustinianism (acknowledging human weakness), his successors further removed the need for grace. The "natural good" becomes more accessible to human reason and encompassable by human powers, diminishing the need for grace to perfect nature (Type 1 grace) or overcome depravity (Type 2 grace).

**II. Moral Sentiments: A Rival Deism (Chapter 15 Introduction):**

1.  **Shaftesbury as Founder:** A different kind of Deism emerges, founded by Shaftesbury, partly in opposition to Locke's. It crystallizes around the theory of "moral sentiments."
2.  **Divergent Roots:**
    *   **Lockean Deism's Roots:** Stemmed from hyper-Augustinian Puritan theology, emphasizing original sin and theological voluntarism (God's law as external, arbitrary, and against human nature). This fostered an affinity with empiricist mechanism and a "command theory of law and morality" (echoed by Hobbes).
    *   **Shaftesbury's Roots:** Drew inspiration from the "Cambridge Platonists" (e.g., Henry More, Ralph Cudworth, Benjamin Whichcote, John Smith).
3.  **Cambridge Platonists' Counter-Argument:**
    *   They vigorously opposed a religion of external law and fear, advocating for intrinsic human attunement to God, a religion of love, and "inward Nature."
    *   They critiqued theological voluntarism as projecting human "Peevishness and Self-will" onto God, arguing that God's will is inherently righteous, wise, and good, not arbitrary.
    *   They used "organic" and "living" metaphors ("true Religion is no Art, but an inward Nature") to contrast with the "mechanical" and "artificial" religion of external command.
    *   Their "Platonism" (influenced by Plotinus, Ficino, Pico) posited a teleological doctrine of nature tending towards good, with a vast "circle of love" throughout the universe.
4.  **Shaftesbury's Synthesis:** Building on autonomous reason (from Locke) and the Cambridge Platonists' "inward nature," Shaftesbury was closest to the **Stoics** (Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius).
    *   **Highest Good:** To love and take joy in the "whole course of the world," achieving "perfect tranquillity and equanimity" by clearing away "false opinions" that the world is imperfect.
    *   **Inner Control:** Emphasized the Stoic principle that only the state of one's own mind, will, or self matters, enabling one to confront all adversity (even death) with an "entire and sound mind," in "friendship with mankind, and in unity with that original mind."

### Section 25

This section, "Moral Sentiments," introduces a **rival Deist tradition** to Locke's "Rationalized Christianity," founded by Shaftesbury and developed by Hutcheson, which emphasizes **intrinsic moral feelings** over external divine commands and instrumental rationality.

Here are the key points:

**I. Shaftesbury's Rival Deism (drawing from Cambridge Platonists & Stoics):**

1.  **Conception of God:**
    *   Shaftesbury's God is the **framer, mover, and animator of an inherently ordered cosmos**, distinct from the God of Abraham or revelation. He is the "universal mind" with whom particular minds should seek harmony.
    *   Theism is a **cosmological belief** in a universe "governed, ordered, or regulated for the best, by a designing principle or mind, necessarily good and permanent," not based on scripture. Atheism (e.g., Epicureanism) is characterized by a denial of this inherent cosmic order.

2.  **Rejection of Lockean Deism and the "Extrinsic Theory of Morality":**
    *   Shaftesbury **utterly rejects God's law as external, arbitrary, or based on fear of punishment**.
    *   He argues that the **highest good resides in the intrinsic nature of the cosmos itself**, and our love for it arises spontaneously, not under duress. A religion of fear is "mercenary and slavish," stifling true piety ("to love God for his own sake").
    *   He fiercely opposes the Lockean/Hobbesian view that morality is merely a matter of arbitrary decrees or laws backed by penalties (the "extrinsic theory").
    *   Shaftesbury asserts that **virtue and vice, right and wrong, have fixed, intrinsic standards in nature**, akin to harmony and dissonance in music or proportion in art/architecture. The "harmony and numbers of the heart" guide moral insight.

3.  **Moral Sources and Autonomous Reason:**
    *   While accepting autonomous reason (a common Enlightenment trait, like Locke), Shaftesbury is not a "rationalist" in the mathematical sense. He grounds moral standards in the "requirements of orderly wholes" and our **inherent bent towards a love of the whole as good**.
    *   He criticizes Lockean "self-disengagement" for obscuring these intrinsic moral sources.

4.  **Shaftesbury's Modernity: "Natural Affection":**
    *   His philosophy is shaped by a "modern, post-Christian" mode of thought, reflected in the term "natural affection" – an innate disposition for disinterested love of mankind and the whole.
    *   **Two Key Modern Shifts:**
        *   **Internalization/Subjectivization of Ethics:** Ancient thought focused on the objective "order of things" as inherently lovable by rational beings. Christian thought (Augustine) introduced inwardness, the potential perversion of will, and the need for grace. Shaftesbury's era makes this inward focus inescapable. The question shifts from *why is the good lovable?* to *what in the subject's make-up (desires, aspirations, feelings, sentiments) makes them recognize and love the good?* While Shaftesbury is close to ancient models, his language of "affection" and "moral sense" strongly suggests this internal turn.
        *   **Transformation into Ethic of Benevolence:** Ancient ethics prioritized harmony, equilibrium, justice, and temperance. Christianity introduced agapé (unconditional love). The "affirmation of ordinary life" integrated this into an ethic of practical beneficence. Shaftesbury, influenced by his time, incorporates "generous affection, kindness, and benignity" and the importance of "doing good" into his Stoic ideal of inner calm, paving the way for benevolence to become the primary virtue.

**II. Hutcheson and the Moral Sense Theory:**

1.  **Against the Extrinsic Theory:** Francis Hutcheson, a major proponent of moral sense theory, directly extends Shaftesbury's opposition to the extrinsic theory, including Locke. He rejects the idea that moral actions are motivated by self-love, self-interest, or divine rewards/punishments, finding it contradictory to common human experience of genuine generosity.

2.  **The Moral Sense:**
    *   Building on Lockean psychology, Hutcheson argues that goodness and generosity are **natural sentiments** that develop within us.
    *   He posits a **"moral sense"**: a "superior Sense" that delivers "immediate Goodness" as brute, un-derivable ideas, much like physical senses deliver sensory data. This directly counters reductive explanations of morality.

3.  **Theological Justification & Its Peril:**
    *   Hutcheson's goal is to laud God's goodness. He admits God *could* have constituted humans to delight in malevolence, but chose to instill benevolence.
    *   However, this admission inadvertently **opens the door to relativism and projectivism**, suggesting moral properties might be subjective "secondary qualities" dependent on our make-up, a pathway later explored by Hume. Hutcheson himself maintains a strong, *anterior* idea of God's goodness.

4.  **Paramountcy of Benevolence & Harmony of Interests:**
    *   Hutcheson is "thoroughly modern" in asserting that **benevolence is the paramount virtue**. All amiable actions are benevolent, and truly virtuous acts maximize "the greatest and most extensive Happiness of all the rational Agents." He redefines classical virtues (e.g., justice) in terms of universal happiness.
    *   He believes in a **divinely designed, perfectly interlocking universe** where individual happiness aligns with universal good ("harmony of interests"). Serving the public good is the most probable way to promote one's own happiness.

5.  **Crucial Disagreement with Extrinsic Theory:**
    *   While Hutcheson *agrees* with extrinsic theorists that a harmony of interests exists and is important to recognize, he **vehemently disagrees that *seeing* this harmony is what *motivates* moral action**.
    *   For Hutcheson, the extrinsic theorists fundamentally misidentify the "mainsprings of moral action," denying the vivid, natural sentiments (benevolence) that truly empower moral life.

### Section 26

This section delves into Francis Hutcheson's moral sentiment theory and introduces Chapter 16, "The Providential Order," which examines the nature of Deist belief.

**I. Hutcheson and the Power of Moral Sentiments:**
*   **Combating Extrinsic Theory:** Hutcheson argues that the Lockean/Hobbesian "extrinsic theory" of morality (based on self-interest, fear, or external rewards) stifles inherent human benevolence.
*   **Belief Fuels Goodness:** He contends that acknowledging and believing in our "natural Propensity to Benevolence" strengthens these moral sentiments, fostering joy and virtuous action. Conversely, disbelieving in them (misanthropic views) dampens them.
*   **Sources of Goodness:** True goodness comes from recognizing these intrinsic moral sources within ourselves, in others, and in God, who instilled them. This conviction, especially the belief in God's universal benevolence, is paramount.
*   **Two Transformations:** Hutcheson's thought, rooted in the Cambridge Platonists via Shaftesbury, internalizes moral inclination into **sentiment** (using Lockean psychology) and elevates **universal benevolence** as the supreme virtue, leading to utilitarian-like concepts ("greatest Happiness for the greatest Numbers").

**II. Comparing Deist Variants:**
*   **Shared Vision:** Both Lockean and Shaftesbury-Hutcheson Deism share a vision of a divinely designed, interlocking universe where all parts conduce to mutual flourishing. Both also employ instrumental reason.
*   **Crucial Difference:** They diverge on how humans participate in this divine order and locate moral sources. For Locke, it's through **disengaged, rational control**. For Hutcheson (and Shaftesbury), it's through **re-engagement**, by turning inward to retrieve and empower our "natural affection" or benevolent sentiments. This difference, though subtle then, foreshadows later cultural oppositions (e.g., Rousseau vs. Romantics).

**III. Chapter 16: The Providential Order – The Force of Deist Belief:**
*   **Deism as Genuine Religion:** The author emphasizes that Deism, often seen as a mere stepping stone to secularism, was a powerful and inspiring religious outlook in its own right, not merely "half-hearted unbelief."
*   **Human-Centered Divine Goodness:** Deist theology defines God's goodness primarily in terms of His benevolence in creating a universe where beings' purposes (especially humans') perfectly interlock, leading to mutual happiness. Human happiness is a *self-contained, non-theocentric* good (fulfillment of natural desires, pleasure), which God's beneficence aims to secure.
*   **Break with Tradition, Rooted in Polemics:** This human-centered view contrasts sharply with traditional Judaeo-Christian thought, where human good is defined by a relation to God. However, Deism draws strength from:
    *   **Erasmian Christianity:** The idea that God's greatness lies in *not needing us*, and His goodness is expressed in exclusively seeking *our* good (polemic against hyper-Augustinian views of human incapacity).
    *   **Affirmation of Ordinary Life:** The Reformation's emphasis on natural human desires and sentiments, rejecting "higher destinies" or "higher activities" (polemic against claims to superior moral or spiritual powers).
*   **Disappearance of Grace:** Consequently, the traditional roles of grace—enabling humans to transcend the natural or overcome fallen depravity—are largely undercut in Deism.
*   **Regular Providence, No Miracles:** Deists reject "particular providences" (God's specific interventions) and miracles. God's goodness is manifest in the *perfect, regular design of nature*. Humans' role is to conform to this order, not to be saved from its disorder. God cannot frequently intervene without frustrating His own harmonious design.

### Section 27

This section, "The Providential Order," explores the implications of Deist belief in a perfectly ordered, benevolent universe, detailing its impact on understandings of suffering, history, the natural order, and moral life.

**I. The Force of Deist Belief: Rejecting Intervention and Marginalizing History**

*   **Necessity of Regular Order:** Deist theology asserts that God's goodness is demonstrated in the perfect, regular design of nature, not through miracles or interventions. Suffering (e.g., pain as a warning system) is explained as a necessary side effect of this regular production of good.
*   **No Divine Intervention:** God cannot adjust laws for particular cases or intervene miraculously, as this would negate the "order of things," undermine human instrumental reason and forethought, and remove the need for active virtue. His goodness is shown in *refraining* from miracles.
*   **Marginalization of Historical Religions:** The paramountcy of a universal, regular order marginalizes the "historical" nature of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, which focus on particular historical events (Sinai, Incarnation) as central to faith. Such events are seen as contingent, divisive, and open to dispute, unable to support universal truths of reason.
*   **"Pedagogy of the Human Race":** Historical narratives are reinterpreted as a pedagogical tool for early, less philosophical humanity, paving the way for a "mature religion" stripped down to universal truths accessible by reason alone (existence of God, Providence, afterlife). Revelation becomes unnecessary.

**II. A New Vision of Order: Meshing Natures, Not Embodied Meanings**

*   **Continuity and Difference:** While Deists like Pope still use traditional imagery like the "great chain of being" and "principle of plenitude" (God filling all levels of existence), their understanding of order differs fundamentally from ancient tradition.
*   **From Expressed Meaning to Meshing Functions:** The new order is not primarily one of "expressed or embodied meanings" or hierarchical possibilities. Instead, it's an order where entities' "natures mesh," their purposes and causal functions "interlock" to form a harmonious whole, where "each in serving itself serves the entire order." This is an "efficient-causal" organicism (e.g., things feeding each other), compatible with mechanistic science.
*   **"Whatever Is, Is Right":** This view, exemplified by Pope and Leibniz (with his "monads" and "pre-established harmony"), establishes absolute confidence in the world's providential design. Superficial "partial evil" is ultimately "universal good," and "WHATEVER IS, IS RIGHT."

**III. "Living According to Nature": A Transformed Moral Ethic**

*   **Shift in Meaning:** The ancient maxim "living according to nature" (meaning living according to a *hierarchical order* of reason, prioritizing contemplation or civic virtue over desire) undergoes a deep transformation.
*   **Ethic of Marked Activities:** For Deists, "living according to nature" means living according to the *design of things*, God's plan. Activities like work and family life are "marked" as significant by this design, not by inherent rational hierarchy. The focus shifts from *what* special acts are done to *how* ordinary life is lived in accordance with God's purpose ("God loveth adverbs").
*   **Affirmation of Natural Inclinations:** This ethic affirms natural inclinations like pleasure and self-love, rejecting Stoic apathy and ascetic moralities. Passions are seen as the "gale" that reason (the "card") must guide, rather than something to be suppressed.
*   **Instrumental Reason and Benevolence:**
    *   Instrumental reason shows that aligning with the interlocking order for the "general good" is the "best policy" for maximizing one's own gains ("true SELF-LOVE and SOCIAL are the same").
    *   It also allows for a "rational perception of the whole order," awakening benevolence and a desire to further the design for its own sake. Benevolence becomes paramount, merging with charity.
*   **Deviances to Avoid:** This ethic rejects: 1) traditional vices (now often justified instrumentally), 2) downgrading ordinary life or self-love in favor of "higher" activities or a hierarchical reason, and 3) condemning natural self-love as sinful.

**IV. Internalization and the Role of Sentiment**

*   **Beyond Exclusively Rational Access:** While instrumental reason is crucial for understanding the design, Deism increasingly incorporates the role of *feeling* and *sentiment* (Shaftesbury, Hutcheson) as another mode of access to this design.
*   **Subjectivization and "Design within Us":** The good is not just an external hierarchical order but something we access by understanding our own inclinations, desires, and sentiments. These internal elements are themselves an "integral part" of the providential design, not mere subjective projections.
*   **Deep Change in Moral Psychology:** This marks a profound shift from ancient views (passions as docile to reason) and even Descartes (passions understood by disengaged reason). The 18th-century theory of sentiments rehabilitates feeling, seeing sentiments as a legitimate way to endorse and rejoice in nature's design, fundamentally altering the understanding of the "constitutive good."

### Section 28

This section details a **profound shift in moral psychology** where **sentiment** gains unprecedented normative status. It argues that undistorted, normal feeling becomes a primary route of access to the "design of things" (the constitutive good), with reason playing a corrective rather than a substitutive role. This completes a revolution in the understanding of nature's norm, transforming it into an **inner tendency or impulse**, foreshadowing Rousseau and the Romantics.

The text then transitions to **Chapter 17, "The Culture of Modernity,"** asserting that this philosophical shift—from hierarchical reason to a providential design affirming ordinary life and the role of sentiment—was a **massive cultural transformation**. It was articulated by philosophers but arose from broader societal movements, manifested in four key areas:

1.  **New Valuation of Commerce:** The 18th century witnessed an increasing appreciation for commercial activity, seen as refining manners, and a decline of the aristocratic honour ethic in favor of a "bourgeois" outlook. This led to the **birth of political economy** (e.g., Adam Smith), grounded in the notion of a *self-regulating economic system* as a prime manifestation of nature's interlocking providential order.
2.  **The Rise of the Modern Novel:**
    *   **Egalitarianism:** Novels by Defoe, Richardson, and Fielding affirmed ordinary life and middle-class subjects, breaking the classical separation of styles to treat all lives with equal seriousness.
    *   **Particularity:** They focused on detailed narratives of *particular* individuals (with proper names) rather than archetypes, reflecting the decline of the "ontic logos" and a new understanding that general truths emerge from scrutinizing the particular.
    *   **New Time-Consciousness:** This era developed a strong sense of historical specificity, moving away from a medieval view of time as a locus for recurrent archetypes. The concept of "homogeneous, empty time" (physics' time) emerged, leading to a new mode of self-narration where individual identity is constituted by particular, causally-linked events and their unfolding meaning, rather than pre-existing models.
3.  **Changing Understanding of Marriage and Family:** From the late 17th century, marriage became idealized as a **voluntary union based on affection, companionship, and concern for children**, seen as a central locus of ordinary life's significance. This fostered individualization, a decline in external control over partner choice, and a demand for **family privacy**, leading to the withdrawal of family life from wider societal interference and a restructuring of domestic space.
4.  **New Importance of Sentiment:** In the 18th century, sentiments like **love, concern, and affection for family members** gained crucial significance. Childhood emerged as a distinct phase, and child-rearing became a major subject. This was not about the *presence* of these feelings, but their **elevated importance** as constitutive elements of a worthy life. The family intensified into a self-conscious "close community of loving and caring," a "haven in a heartless world," making new emotional demands on its members and valuing **full emotional expression**. Sentiment took on **moral relevance**, becoming for some "the key to the human good," with even the hope of immortality reinterpreted as a "family reunion."

### Section 29

This section elaborates on the **moral consecration of sentiment** and its widespread cultural impact, moving from literature to a transformed appreciation of nature, and paralleling religious revivals.

1.  **Sentiment in Literature:** The moral elevation of sentiment became prominent in 18th-century English and French literature. Novels like Richardson's *Pamela* and *Clarissa*, and especially Rousseau's *La Nouvelle Héloise*, depicted noble sentiments and the heroism of renunciation (e.g., lovers sacrificing immediate fulfillment for duty), profoundly influencing readers. This "cult of sensibility" celebrated strong, pure, uncorrupted feeling, seeing it as ennobling and leading to a "purity of feeling" even through suffering and unfulfilled love ("nothing is good but loving, nothing is true but suffering").

2.  **Slide to Melancholy:** This cult, however, could easily descend into self-indulgent melancholy, savored as a mark of superior sensibility. English works like Young's "Night Thoughts" and Gray's "Elegy" shaped this mood. Goethe's *The Sorrows of Young Werther* cemented the archetype of the "sensitive man" (*homme sensible*) driven to despair and suicide by extreme sensibility and an inability to attain ordinary happiness.

3.  **Feeling for Nature:** A new appreciation for nature emerged, shifting from formal, rationally ordered gardens (like Le Nôtre's neo-Classical designs, reflecting an "ontic logos") to the "jardin anglais." This wasn't about rustic virtue but about the powerful sentiments nature could awaken: awe, peace, sublimity, melancholy. Nature became a "great keyboard" for human feelings, valued not for its inherent objective order (as in earlier cosmologies like Shakespeare's), but for how it *resonated within us* and what it evoked in the human subject. This marked a profound departure from defining nature by objective rational order to defining it by its effect on our inner, feeling selves. This modern relationship to nature, where meaning is accessed by turning inward, presupposes the triumph of "disengaged reason" and our identity defined by inner impulses, not external rational order. Even later Romantic cosmologies, while re-establishing a meaningful order, still require an inward turn to access it.

4.  **Religious Revivals:** Parallel to these secular developments, religious movements like Pietism, Methodism, and Chassidism also emphasized intense personal feeling and devotion over doctrinal correctness, signaling a similar shift in the importance of emotional experience.

5.  **Historical Causation and Common Themes (Introduction to Chapter 18):** These philosophical and literary shifts articulate a **massive cultural transformation** originating in the upper-middle classes, leading to a family of resembling moral cultures across nations and classes. Common themes include:
    *   **Individualism:** Prizing autonomy, self-exploration (especially of feeling), and personal commitment.
    *   **Universal Subjective Rights:** Formulation of immunities based on individual rights.
    *   **Affirmation of Ordinary Life:** Significance of productive work and the family as a central, love-based community.
    *   **Moral Centrality of Feelings:** Importance of exploring and expressing emotions.
    *   **Benevolence:** As a key social virtue.
    The author emphasizes a **complex, circular relationship** between this moral culture, socio-economic "base" (e.g., economic practices, administrative structures), and philosophical formulations, where each influences and reinforces the others, rather than a simple linear causality.

### Section 30

This section delves into the complex, circular relationship between philosophical formulations ("constitutive goods") and broader cultural movements ("life goods"). It argues that neither has absolute priority, but rather influence and reinforce each other.

**Key Points:**

*   **Interplay of Philosophy and Culture:**
    *   Philosophers articulate "constitutive goods" (underlying moral sources), while cultures develop "life goods" (new notions of the good life, e.g., the loving family, expression of feeling, benevolence).
    *   This is a "circular relation" like that between "base" and "superstructure"—neither is fully independent or has absolute priority.
    *   Philosophical articulations can both "fit" the spirit of unreflecting cultural practices and "alter" them, changing the life good itself.
*   **Deism as an Example:**
    *   The Deist notion of natural order (a constitutive good) "caught the spirit" of emerging 18th-century moral culture (life goods like autonomy, family significance, benevolence).
    *   While Deism itself lost credit, the broader movement of life goods evolved *out of* it, moving into the orbit of other formulations. Deism thus had a "Wirkungsgeschichte" (historically efficacious influence) in shaping modern moral culture, even if it didn't contain it.
*   **The Question of Secularization:**
    *   Secularization (regression of belief in God, decline of religious practice) is presented as a *problem to explain*, not an explanation itself.
    *   The author critiques common "inevitable" explanations:
        *   **Institutional changes** (industrialization, technology, mobility) are insufficient; they influence the *forms* of religious belief, but don't unambiguously cause its decline across all civilizations.
        *   **Science and education** are dismissed as often rooted in ideological prejudice; modern science frequently had religious ties and can still inspire piety.
    *   **Core Explanation for Secularization:** The crucial change is that people no longer find the spiritual dimension of their lives *incomprehensible without God*. For earlier ages, God was inextricably bound to *all credible moral sources*.
    *   The modern "tentativeness" or loss of certainty in belief represents an "epistemic gain" because **alternative, non-theistic moral sources have opened up**.
*   **"Availability" of Moral Sources:**
    *   "Availability" means more than just being logically conceivable or present in tradition (e.g., ancient pagan views were not truly "available" in a transformative sense for most until much later).
    *   Truly available sources must: 1) **capture important life goods** of the age (e.g., benevolence, affirmation of ordinary life, post-Augustinian inwardness), and 2) **relate these to constitutive goods recognizable within the existing spiritual life**.
*   **Two Frontiers of Alternative Moral Sources:** The text identifies two main directions that emerged from Christian culture and prepared the way for non-theistic morality:
    1.  **Within the agent's own powers:** The dignity of **rational order and control** (from Descartes/Locke/Kant), which, though initially placed in a theistic perspective (human reason as God's image), laid the foundation for an independent, non-theistic morality.
    2.  **In the depths of nature:** The notion of **providential order** as an interlocking network conducing to sentient creatures' happiness, accessed through reason and *feeling*. As this good became "purely natural, self-contained," nature itself became a prime moral source *without its Author*.
    *   Both frontiers originated within Christian thought but stood "ready for a mutation" where these moral sources could only be fully acknowledged in their *non-theistic form*, requiring an "additional stimulus" that will be explored in later chapters.
*   **Conclusion:** Understanding secularization requires explaining the **cultural mutation** by which alternative, non-theistic moral sources became available, not just the removal of obstacles to "enlightenment."

### Section 31

This section, "Fractured Horizons," further elaborates on the nature of modern moral culture, characterized by a **multiplicity of moral sources** and a pervasive **sense of uncertainty**.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Three Moral Directions/Sources:** Modern moral culture exists as a "space" where individuals can draw from three main directions:
    *   The **original theistic foundation** (belief in God).
    *   **Two independent "frontiers"** that emerged from Christian spirituality but are now seen as distinct:
        *   The dignity of **rational order and control** within the agent's own powers.
        *   The goodness of **nature** as a self-contained moral source.

2.  **Uncertainty and Contestation of Adequacy:**
    *   This multiplicity contributes to widespread **tentativeness** and a lack of the "rooted confidence" seen in earlier ages.
    *   **Theism** is contested primarily on its *truth*. However, its *adequacy* as a moral source, if true, is generally not doubted.
    *   The **two modern frontiers** (rational agency, nature) face a deeper challenge: a "contestation of adequacy." Even if their principles are recognized as true (e.g., dignity of reason, goodness of nature), the nagging question "So what?" arises as to whether they are sufficient to justify the moral weight placed upon them.
    *   This "challenge of inadequacy" drives continuous **exploration** and redefinition within these non-theistic sources.

3.  **Complex Relations: Rivalry and Mutual Influence:**
    *   The three sources can be seen as rivals, leading to "contestation and rivalry" (e.g., anti-humanist theists vs. complacent agnostics).
    *   However, they are also **complementary** and engage in **mutual influence and interchange**.
    *   **Christian faith** has been transformed by incorporating ideals that originated on its fringes or outside it (e.g., reducing suffering from radical Enlightenment figures like Bentham/Beccaria, expressive integrity, sexual equality, world economic justice). The "decline of Hell" also reflects both religious sensibility and secular critique.
    *   The author asserts his belief that **secular humanism**, while originating from a mutation of Judeo-Christian faith, also reflects a **continuing dependence** on it, not just a historical origin.

4.  **Critique of the "Enlightenment" Narrative:**
    *   The author prepares to discuss the "Radical Enlightenment" by challenging the "facile view" that secularization simply flows from the progress of science and reason, removing barriers to truth.
    *   He argues that this view is "terribly anachronistic," as for figures like Descartes, the existence of God was inseparable from their moral lives and reasoning power. Laplace's famous "I have not needed this hypothesis" represents a fundamental *shift in what reason means* and its moral place, not merely a natural progression.

5.  **Introduction to the Radical Enlightenment (Chapter 19):**
    *   The next chapters will explore two "constellations" that combine the two non-theistic frontiers in characteristic ways:
        1.  **Disengaged reason + instrumental reading of nature** (Radical Enlightenment).
        2.  **Creative imagination + nature as an inner moral source**.
    *   Chapter 19 focuses on the first: the mutation from Deism to the **radical, unbelieving Enlightenment** (e.g., Bentham, Holbach, Helvétius).

6.  **The Radical Enlightenment's Core Tenets (Holbach as Example):**
    *   They rejected the Deist notion of **providential order**, basing ethics purely on **utility** (maximizing happiness/pleasure, minimizing pain).
    *   They viewed the world and human nature as a **neutral domain** to be understood and mastered through causal-genetic examination, rather than having inherent good or bad "bents" (Helvétius).
    *   Despite rejecting Deism's *constitutive good* (providence), they were **even more strongly committed to its *life goods***:
        *   **Self-responsible reason** (freedom from authority, autonomous thought).
        *   The central significance of **ordinary fulfilments** (happiness, production, family life).
        *   **Universal and impartial benevolence**.
    *   They believed they were *enhancing* these life goods by demolishing their supposed providential foundation.
    *   **Holbach's *Système de la nature*** exemplifies this: presents uncompromising monistic materialism where man is entirely physical. Self-preservation and the pursuit of happiness are inherent drives ("gravitation sur soi"). Nature herself calls humans to cease seeking "outside of the world" and embrace their natural desires, freeing themselves from "superstitious" religion which depreciates these impulses.
    *   The Radical Utilitarians saw themselves as more effectively fighting the "downgrading of ordinary life" and the "condemnation of natural self-love" than their Deist predecessors, by stressing the physical nature of human desire.

### Section 32

This section, "Radical Enlightenment," elaborates on the core tenets of radical utilitarianism and materialism, highlighting a fundamental tension between their explicit theories and their implicit moral motivations.

**Key Points:**

*   **Exaltation of Sensual Pleasure:**
    *   Figures like Helvétius and Bentham declared physical pain and pleasure to be the sole principles of human action, vehemently rejecting "asceticism" (philosophic pride, religious fear of a "splenetic Deity").
    *   By affirming the *physical nature* of desire, they sought to defend its equal value and goodness more integrally, leading to an **exaltation of the sensual**.
    *   This turn, exemplified by Diderot's *Supplément au voyage de Bougainville* (Orou's defense of natural sexuality against repressive religion), is presented as an **irreversible cultural change**, marking sensual fulfillment as significant.
    *   **Sensualism as Radical Naturalism:** Taking a stand on "raw human desire" became a way to challenge all established systems (law, politics, religion) that suppressed natural demands or created "imaginary crimes."

*   **Universal and Impartial Benevolence:**
    *   The radical Aufklärer believed that freedom from superstition and parochial customs through **rational understanding** would lead to a capacity for seeing and wanting the "universal good."
    *   They often confused this with the idea of a **harmony of interests**, where individual happiness would naturally conduce to general happiness in a properly organized world (Holbach, Condorcet).
    *   They also implicitly assumed a **selfless benevolence** from enlightened individuals, who would sacrifice for future generations, feeling their own good motivations linked to rational insight (Bentham's *cri de coeur*).
    *   This focus on sensual pleasure/pain allowed the **relief of suffering** (human and animal) to be placed at the center of the social agenda, having revolutionary effects. Disengaged rationality was seen as a "victory over egoism," enabling an "impartial spectator" view for the universal good.

*   **The Core Paradox: Reductive Ontology vs. Moral Impetus:**
    *   Despite their fervent moral motivations (affirming nature's demands, freeing universal benevolence), the radical Aufklärer's **reductive theories of human nature**—insisting on the physical nature of moral life, reducing all motivation to pleasure, and denying ontological space for "higher" aspirations—paradoxically **abolished the space for "strong evaluation."**
    *   Bentham's utilitarianism, for example, defined pleasure not as a strongly valued good, but as the only good, aiming to erase distinctions between moral and non-moral desires. This meant it couldn't express the moral significance of benevolence or the self-sacrificing commitment that drove its proponents.
    *   Similarly, Holbach's materialism (reducing desire to gravity) left no room for shame or remorse, yet his arguments implicitly relied on these moral reactions to motivate benevolent action.

*   **Materialism as an "Underdetermined Ethical Position":**
    *   The author argues that materialism or hedonism alone does not necessarily lead to universal benevolence; it could equally underpin "despairing amoralism" or "egoistic gratification," as exemplified by La Mettrie and most starkly by **Sade**.
    *   **Sade's views** (nature is "immoral," imposes no limits, all social constraints should be thrown off) serve as a foil, exposing the **unacknowledged "moral horizon"** of Enlightenment humanism—a background understanding of what is worthy of "strong evaluation" (the value of ordinary happiness, the demand for universal beneficence) that the materialist theories themselves struggle to justify.
    *   This problem was more salient in France, where a history of tension between ethical outlooks and a more clandestine, anti-clerical Deism contrasted with the smoother transition in Anglo-Saxon countries.

*   **Unresolved Dilemma of Justification:**
    *   The Enlightenment materialists confused *descriptive claims* (e.g., harmony of interests, human sympathy) with *prescriptive moral ideals*. They struggled to answer "Why ought I to seek" the general good, especially at personal cost, if the theory reduces all motivation to individual pleasure/pain and rejects strong evaluation.
    *   This fundamental tension between their **reductive ontology** and their **moral impetus** makes their theories difficult to reconcile, contributing to the paradoxical situation where their deep moral commitments are evident in their spirit but cannot be coherently stated within their own theoretical frameworks. This issue became more apparent as religious faith declined as the dominant moral source.

### Section 33

This section critiques the inherent contradictions and limitations within Enlightenment naturalism, particularly classical utilitarianism, while also exploring alternative, more self-aware paths within naturalistic thought.

**Key Points:**

1.  **Self-Concealing Philosophy:** Enlightenment naturalism, especially in its later Anglo-Saxon forms, adopted a "rationalist self-image" that suppressed its own moral motivations. Its theories, like classical utilitarianism, became "inarticulate" because their reductive ontologies prevented them from explicitly recognizing their own moral sources (e.g., universal benevolence, value of ordinary fulfillment).
2.  **"Denunciatory Words of Power":** Due to this self-concealment, the moral commitments of these philosophies primarily emerged indirectly through polemics and denunciations of perceived errors, superstition, and suffering caused by religion or traditional metaphysics. What they attacked implicitly revealed what they cherished. This makes them "parasitic" on their adversaries for articulating their moral force.
3.  **Doubly Parasitic Nature:**
    *   It relies on *enemies* for its "words of power," defining itself by what it opposes.
    *   It also borrows foundational moral ideals (e.g., humility, value of common fulfillments) from earlier *Christian or Deist frameworks* which it explicitly undermines without providing new, justified grounds for them, a borrowing highlighted by Nietzsche.
4.  **Limitations in Construction:** While effective in *opposition* (exposing societal ills), this denunciatory philosophy proves "thin and threatening" when it tries to *build* a new social order. Its exclusive focus on instrumental efficacy for happiness, lacking a positive vision of diverse goods, can lead to destructive "levelling and suppression" (e.g., Poor Law Act of 1834, Chernobyl, Jacobin Terror, Marxist purges). It is "philosophically debarred" from acknowledging other goods, making it a philosophy suited only for opposition.
5.  **Alternative Path for Naturalism (Diderot, Hume):** The author proposes a different route: naturalism acknowledging and articulating its own moral horizon. This involves finding significance in ordinary human fulfillments and life goods (reason, happiness, benevolence) not through a providential cosmic order, but through a "human-given" meaning—something humans "cannot but see as thus significant" in an "undistorted and illusion-free" self-interpretation. This acts as an immanent "constitutive good."
6.  **Hume's Neo-Lucretian Spirit:** David Hume is presented as an early example of this alternative. He denied the providential worldview but, unlike the radical Aufklärer who sought disengaged control for "marvellous remaking," Hume aimed for "self-acceptance" and "engagement" with human nature. His "anatomy of moral sentiments" was meant to help humans accept, endorse, and cherish their inherent psychological make-up and the significance they naturally accord to things, even if that significance lacks extra-human ontological warrant. This is a "home-coming to a garden," accepting a limited, imperfect human space, inspired by Lucretian ideas of rejecting external demands that disrupt inner peace.
7.  **Spiritual Significance of Naturalism:** The section concludes by identifying a distinct spiritual dimension within naturalism: the awe and wonder awakened by the emergence of conscious thought, feeling, and moral aspiration from a vast, indifferent physical universe. This view, which emphasizes human fragility and the mystery of consciousness, stands in "flat contradiction" to Cartesian dualism's emphasis on the soul's purity and transcendence.

### Section 34

This section delves into the inherent spiritual dimension of materialism and naturalism, often unacknowledged, and then transitions to the Enlightenment's distinct narrative structures, culminating in a preview of the counter-Enlightenment critique of its "levelling" tendencies, particularly through Rousseau.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Materialism's Unarticulated Spiritual Stance:**
    *   Locke's suggestion that thought might be a property of matter sparked intense metaphysical debate, challenging the dualism that underpinned traditional religious and moral beliefs.
    *   The author argues that while materialists aimed to subvert tradition, their philosophy implicitly contained its **own characteristic spiritual stance** – one of profound awe and mystery, often unacknowledged due to Enlightenment naturalism's "self-imposed inarticulacy" about its moral sources.
    *   This is illustrated by modern writer Douglas Hofstadter, who describes reductionism as "the ultimate religion" that "adds mystery" and evokes "cosmic awe" at the emergence of complexity from an "insubstantial ether."
    *   Holbach's materialism, breaking from Cartesian inert matter, pictures nature as a "locus of force" from which thought can emerge, awakening awe.
    *   Diderot, in *Le Rêve de d'Alembert*, poetically expresses this "emergentist" view, depicting life as a sublime progression from inert matter to sentient, thinking, and even genius-level beings, ultimately returning to "humus."
    *   This spiritual attitude has ancient roots (e.g., Epicurean/Lucretian awe at the universe as a nourishing, vast whole).
    *   Over the 18th century, this materialist perspective moved from outlandish to, in some circles, an orthodox outlook, often evolving into theories of **"emergence"** and "levels of being" rather than strict Cartesian dualism.

2.  **New Sense of Cosmic Time and Awe at Immensity:**
    *   This "emergentist spiritual stance," shared by materialists and proto-Romantics (like Goethe and Schiller), fostered a **new sense of cosmic time**.
    *   It moved beyond the eternal, unchanging classical cosmos or the short biblical timeline, embracing **geological time** – an immense scale filled with cataclysmic changes.
    *   This change, partly scientific (Buffon), also reflected a shift in imagination. Diderot foresaw "infinite succession of animalculae" and species.
    *   Travel writers like Ramond articulated an exaltation before the vast, untamed, and indifferent immensity of nature (e.g., Alps, Pyrenees), inspiring meditations that make the "soul... soar over the abyss of time."

3.  **Enlightenment Naturalism's Narrative of Progress and Posterity:**
    *   Enlightenment naturalism created specific **narrative structures** for individual lives and history, rooted in three moral poles: self-responsible reason, natural impulses, and benevolence.
    *   The core narrative is a **struggle from "blindness and error"** (superstition, imposture) towards "perfection" through "unchained reason," which unmasks error and releases the "dignity of nature."
    *   This applies biographically (the Aufklärer's own growth) and historically (humanity's progress, successive discoveries of truth).
    *   The Aufklärer finds significance and **"immortality"** by contributing to this progress, motivated by the **recognition and gratitude of future generations** (posterity). This expectation serves as a crucial "consolation" for present sacrifices and persecutions.
    *   Diderot wrote his most profound works for future readers, and Holbach declared faith in a future "boundless mass of light."
    *   Condorcet's *Esquisse* epitomizes this philosophy of history, describing humanity's progress through ten ages to a radiant future. His personal reflections, written while in hiding from the Jacobins, underscore how this vision provided refuge and "true reward" amidst contemporary "errors, crimes, and injustices."

4.  **Introduction to the Anti-Levelling Objection and Rousseau:**
    *   The chapter then introduces the "anti-levelling objection" as a key critique of Enlightenment naturalism, which had pushed the denial of qualitative distinctions in the will even further (reducing all to desire, even physical).
    *   **Rousseau** is presented as a crucial figure in this counter-movement, challenging the philosophes despite initial friendships.
    *   Rousseau brought back the **"fundamentally Augustinian notion" of two loves** or basic orientations of the will, rejecting the idea that moral evil could be overcome merely by more knowledge or enlightenment; instead, it required a "transformation of the will."
    *   He denied Cartesian self-transparency, aligning with Pascal and Jansenists in seeing the self as a "monstre incompréhensible," full of contradictions and unknown depths.
    *   Crucially, Rousseau **transposed this Augustinian framework into Deism**, replacing divine grace with the "voice of nature" (conscience) as the source of "higher love." He asserted that "the first impulses of nature are always right" and that "there is no original perversity in the human heart."
    *   However, he believed humanity suffered a "Fall" through corrupt culture, losing contact with this inner voice by depending on others' opinions.
    *   Rousseau vehemently rejected the Enlightenment idea that "reason" or "lumières" necessarily make people better, arguing that the progress of "calculating reason" can be a sign of corruption when conscience is stifled. Conscience is depicted as a "divine instinct," an "infallible judge" that elevates humans above beasts, a guide superior to "an unbridled understanding and a reason which knows no principle."

### Section 35

This section, "Nature as Source," elaborates on Rousseau's counter-Enlightenment philosophy and introduces Kant's distinct but related concept of autonomy, before briefly touching upon the "expressivist turn" in Romanticism.

**Rousseau's Non-Primitivist Recovery of Nature:**
*   **Beyond Primitivism:** The author clarifies that Rousseau's call to recover contact with nature is not a literal return to a pre-cultural stage. Instead, it's about escaping "calculating other-dependence" and the tyranny of opinion through an alignment of reason, culture, and the "true élan of nature."
*   **Conscience and General Will:** Conscience is framed as the "voice of nature" emerging *within* social, linguistic, and rational beings. The "general will" represents the demands of nature, free from social distortions, embodied in publicly recognized law.
*   **Austerity and True Freedom:** Rousseau champions austerity, drawing on Stoic ideals. True strength and freedom come from limiting needs and being content with one's essential self, resisting the multiplication of wants driven by dependence on others and appearances.
*   **Affirmation of Ordinary Life:** This austere freedom is crucial for both individual integrity (e.g., Emile's education, emphasizing useful trade and marital fulfillment) and a virtuous polity. Rousseau attempts to integrate ancient civic humanism with a modern affirmation of "ordinary life," where the common good is self-evident in simple communities.
*   **Transposition of Deism and Moral Polarity:** While borrowing from Deist ideas (e.g., a good God inferred from cosmic order), Rousseau fundamentally transposes them. He replaces the Enlightenment's "bland assurance" of harmonizing interests with a "keen sense of the polarity of good and evil" and the need for a "transformation of the human will."
*   **Modern Subjectivism and Inner Voice:** Rousseau pushes modern moral understanding towards greater subjectivism. Goodness is identified with inner freedom and self-sufficiency, finding the motives for action *within oneself*. He is presented as a "crucial hinge figure" who, through his eloquence, enlarged the scope of the "inner voice" as the definitive source of moral truth, even if he himself did not fully disconnect it from a providential order. This marks a shift from Augustinian unity in God to finding unity *within the self*.

**Kant's Radical Autonomy:**
*   **Anti-Levelling Critique:** Like Rousseau, Kant rebels against Enlightenment naturalism and utilitarianism, which he believes negate morality and freedom by reducing all to desire.
*   **Morality as Formal Freedom:** For Kant, morality and freedom are interdependent. Moral action is defined not by its outcome, but by the "formal" motive of conforming to the moral law, which is dictated by the *nature of reason itself*. To act morally is to act according to one's true nature as a rational agent, on universalizable principles.
*   **Rejection of Given Nature:** This is a radical definition of freedom, rejecting "nature as what is merely given." Freedom comes from a life whose normative shape is *generated by rational activity*—a pure "self-activity" where one formulates rational law rather than being determined by external facts or desires. This concept profoundly influenced later thinkers like Fichte, Hegel, and Marx.
*   **Human Dignity and Obligation:** Central to Kant's ethics is the unique dignity of rational beings, who stand out because they are free and self-determining, capable of formulating laws for themselves. This "incomparably higher" status imposes an obligation to live up to it, treating rational nature as an "end in itself" rather than a mere means.
*   **Anthropocentric Enlightenment:** Kant redefines Enlightenment as "man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity"—a growth in moral freedom and responsibility. His view, deeply rooted in Augustinian ideas of "radical evil" and the transformation of the will (often via Protestant Pietism), is distinctively anthropocentric, as the source of this transformation lies in *rational agency within oneself*.
*   **Secularized Benevolence:** Kant provides a clear basis for the Enlightenment's faith that rationality brings benevolence. For him, a "principle of universal justice" (acting by universal maxims, treating all as ends) flows directly from practical reason, representing a "secularized variant of agapé" that grows stronger with enlightenment, underpinning modern humanitarian aspirations.

**The Expressivist Turn:**
*   **Nature as Inner Source:** The section concludes by introducing another form of modern internalization: the view, originating with Rousseau and developed by German Sturm und Drang and Romanticism (e.g., Herder, Goethe, Hegel), that nature is an *inner source* of moral truth.
*   **Romantic Rebellion and Inner Voice:** This "philosophy of nature as source" provided crucial justification for the Romantic rebellion against neo-Classical norms, affirming the rights of the individual, imagination, and feeling, often expressed as an "inner voice" or "impulse of nature" that enables humans to become "the organ of sense of [their] God in all the living things of creation."

### Section 36

This section, "The Expressivist Turn," delves into the philosophical shift towards viewing "nature as an inner source" and its profound implications for human life, morality, art, and individuation, particularly in the Romantic era.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Nature as an Inner Source vs. Earlier Deism:**
    *   While sharing a belief in a providential natural order with earlier Deists (e.g., Shaftesbury), the "nature as inner source" view, originating with Rousseau, emphasizes that access to this order is primarily **inward**.
    *   For Deists, significance was appreciated by observing external order; for the new view, it comes from an **inner impulse or conviction**—the "voice of nature within us."
    *   This internal mode of access is crucial: a "cold, external understanding" misses the point. It implies a "two-loves" view, where the inner voice can be stifled by "disengaged, calculating reason."
    *   This perspective has a **filiation with theories of grace**, requiring an opening to the *élan of nature* akin to opening oneself to God's grace.
    *   A "slide" away from strict orthodoxy becomes possible: once inner access is primary, external doctrines become interpretations of this internal experience, leading easily to **pantheism** (e.g., Schelling, Hegel, Goethe) where God is interpreted through what strives in nature and finds voice within.

2.  **Centrality of Sentiment and its Redefinition of the Good:**
    *   This philosophy champions **sentiment** as the path to deepest moral and cosmic truths ("The heart is the key to the world and life," Novalis; "truth... carried alive into the heart by passion," Wordsworth).
    *   The good life involves being attuned to the "impulse of nature," which is inseparable from having certain sentiments.
    *   It differs from Aristotelian ethics (where sentiments are defined by actions) by suggesting that the **way of life or action is defined by the sentiments** themselves (e.g., a sense of oneness with humanity, joy in nature).
    *   It also differs from Platonic love of the Good (where sentiments are defined by a transcendent object) by asserting that **nature as a source is defined by what its impulses impel us to**, articulated partly through our sentiments. Sentiments thus become integral to the original definition of the good.

3.  **Ethical "Slides" and the Aesthetic-Ethical Blur:**
    *   If the good life is defined by sentiments, it can diverge from traditional ethical codes.
    *   Initially, sentiments align with benevolence (Rousseau, Herder). However, this path can lead to:
        *   **Redefinition of sensual fulfillment:** Sensuality can gain higher significance, leading to a fusion of sensual and spiritual, potentially abandoning traditional restraints.
        *   **Detachment from benevolence:** The "source of heightened vibrancy" can be detached from solidarity, notably articulated later by Nietzsche.
    *   This ultimately tends to **dissolve the distinction between the ethical and the aesthetic**. As ethics becomes defined by sentiments and traditional virtues are re-evaluated, the lines blur, making it difficult to categorize ideals (e.g., Nietzsche's superman).

4.  **Expressivism and Radical Individuation:**
    *   The "philosophy of nature as a source" aligns with an **expressive view of human life**: realizing one's nature means articulating what is found within, which in turn *defines* what is to be realized. This is a "making manifest" and a "bringing something to be," not mere copying.
    *   This concept is linked to **biological models of growth** (Herder), where inner "powers" (Kräfte) strive for external realization, combining Aristotelian potential with modern self-articulation (e.g., Leibniz's monads as proto-selves).
    *   This underpins a **radical individuation**: the idea that each person is unique, original, and has an **obligation to live up to their originality**. Unlike earlier notions of diverse vocations (e.g., St. Paul), this emphasizes an unrepeatable "measure" unique to each individual.
    *   Since the "voice of nature" cannot be fully known prior to articulation, each individual's path may be unique and "without precedent."
    *   This influential idea has become a cornerstone of modern culture and was also applied by Herder to **national cultures** ("Völker"), laying the groundwork for modern nationalism.

5.  **Art's Transformed Role and the Creative Imagination:**
    *   The expressive view of life naturally elevates **art** to a central position, defining human nature and serving as a spiritual touchstone, sometimes replacing religion.
    *   Art shifts from **mimesis (imitation) to expression**: it no longer simply copies reality but *makes something manifest while at the same time realizing and completing it*. This revolution confers immense significance on artistic expression, seeing it as rescuing humanity from "disengaged reason."
    *   Art gains **cosmic significance**: the artist is seen as a "creator God" (Herder), imitating the author of nature, not merely nature itself. The artwork becomes a "locus of manifestation," revealing what is hidden (Shelley, Wordsworth).
    *   This shift necessitates the concept of the **creative imagination** (Coleridge's "Imagination proper"), which produces something new and unprecedented, a repetition of "the eternal act of creation."
    *   The **Romantic symbol**, unlike allegory, allows the infinite and otherwise invisible to enter our world and become manifest.

### Section 37

This section, "The Expressivist Turn," continues by elaborating on the radical shift in understanding art, history, and morality prompted by the "nature as source" philosophy.

**1. The Transformed Role of Art and the Symbol:**
*   **Symbol vs. Sign:** The section begins by defining the Romantic symbol as a "translucence of the eternal through and in the temporal," inherently partaking in the reality it reveals, unlike a mere external sign.
*   **Interpenetration of Form and Matter:** This concept underpins the ideal of art where "matter" (e.g., language, material) is entirely taken up in manifestation, and what is manifested is only available within the symbol, not independently defined. Kant's aesthetics influenced this.
*   **Decline of Cosmic Order:** This new understanding of art arose partly because the "cosier pictures of harmony" and the "ontic logos" of the Enlightenment faded, replaced by a Romantic view of nature's purpose as enigmatic and only graspable through participation.
*   **Art's New Creative Mandate:** Since cosmic order was no longer exoterically "there to be imitated," art had to explore and manifest it through a "new language," creating its own "cosmic syntax" and "poetic reality." The artist becomes a creator, making something "subtler" and previously unarticulated (e.g., Wordsworth, Hölderlin, Friedrich).

**2. Two Responses to Enlightenment Naturalism:**
*   **Kant's Autonomy:** Seeks moral integrity through a "radical break with nature," emphasizing a distinct, formal quality of moral motivation.
*   **Nature as Source (Expressivism):** Rescues the moral dimension by finding it in the "élan of nature itself," advocating a recovery of connection.
*   **Incompatibility and Affinity:** These two paths are inherently incompatible (Kant sees expressivism as heteronomous; expressivism sees Kant as denying nature). However, they share a common starting point (perceived inadequacy of Enlightenment naturalism's moral dimension) and both involve "internalizations" and centrality of freedom.

**3. The Aspiration for Unity and the "Spiral" View of History:**
*   **Reconciliation:** A profound need emerged to combine Kantian autonomy with expressive unity, aiming for a "fulfilment in which nature and reason would once more be in alignment" (Kant's *summum bonum*; "perfected art becomes nature again").
*   **Necessary Breach and Higher Return:** Expressivist thinkers (Schiller, Hölderlin, Hegel) theorized that the "breach of reason with nature was a necessary one" for human development, leading to a "return to nature at a higher level," a synthesis of reason and desire.
*   **Historical Spiral:** This gave rise to a historical model resembling a spiral: primitive undifferentiated unity → conflictual division → higher reconciliation, retaining the gains of reason and freedom. This structure is rooted in the Christian salvation history (Paradise → Fall → Redemption).

**4. Modern Political Messianism (Millenarism):**
*   **Secularization:** The late 18th century saw a third development, modern political messianism, which secularized the long-standing millenarist tradition (Joachim of Fiore, Middle Ages, Reformation).
*   **Crisis and Polarization:** This framework, evident in the French Revolution, envisioned a crisis leading to unprecedented polarization between good and evil, intense suffering, but ultimately an unparalleled victory and a new epoch of justice and freedom.
*   **Rousseauian Influence:** This secular millenarism drew on Rousseau's language of virtue, patriotism, and freedom against vice and tyranny, requiring a stronger sense of good and evil than Enlightenment naturalism offered.
*   **Philosophical Elaboration:** In Germany, this combined with the expressivist theory of nature as source, leading to the philosophical "spiral view of history" (Schiller, Schelling, Hölderlin, Hegel), initially with revolutionary expectations, later as a dawning, higher age. Marx later reinstated the element of polarization and total victory into this spiral.

**5. Expressivist Narratives vs. Enlightenment Progress:**
*   Expressivist conceptions of history (spiral, or pessimistic decline/nostalgia for a richer past) broke sharply with Enlightenment linear progress. They questioned the uncritical acceptance of scientific knowledge, technological know-how, and riches as unadulterated goods.

**6. The Enduring Battle of Spiritual Outlooks:**
*   The conflict between "instrumental reason" (human control over objectified nature) and the expressivist understanding of "nature as a source" (attunement to nature, solidarity with life) continues today.
*   This "battle between spiritual outlooks" is seen in ecological politics: one side seeks technical solutions to environmental problems through more instrumental reason, while the other advocates recognizing our place in a larger life order and an allegiance to it, rejecting a purely instrumental stance.
*   Even though the explicit "Romantic religions of nature" have faded, the demand to be "open to or in tune with nature in ourselves and outside" remains a powerful, though problematic, spiritual outlook.

### Section 38

This section, "Our Victorian Contemporaries," serves as a transition into Part V, asserting that the Enlightenment and Romanticism (with its expressivist conception of humanity) fundamentally shaped our modern cultural and moral outlook. It argues that the Victorians are our "contemporaries" because they were the first to grapple significantly with and develop the implications of these transformations, establishing many of the moral imperatives and self-conceptions we still hold today.

Here are the key points:

1.  **The Enduring Legacy of Enlightenment and Romanticism:**
    *   Modern cultural life, self-conceptions, and moral outlooks still operate in the wake of these two great transformations. We are still "working out their implications" and exploring possibilities they opened.
    *   The Victorians are particularly "close to us" because they were deeply involved in this process, developing many of the moral and political standards (e.g., universal equality, democracy, the idea of moral progress) that we now take for granted.

2.  **Key Moral Imperatives Inherited from the Period:**
    *   **Reduction of Suffering:** A central moral imperative stemming from the Enlightenment's emphasis on the "significance of ordinary life" and the ideal of "universal benevolence." This manifests in humanitarian campaigns and a universal concern for alleviating suffering.
    *   **Freedom and Self-Determination:** The ideal of the "free, self-determining subject" is paramount, grounded in both the decline of cosmic order and the modern subject's reflexive powers (disengaged reason, creative imagination). Freedom, whether "negative" (absence of constraint) or "positive" (self-realization from an inner source), is universally recognized as a good.
    *   **Universal Justice and Equality:** Combined with universal benevolence, freedom has generated a demand for universal justice, expressed through subjective rights, the erosion of hierarchy (social classes, races, genders), and the ascendancy of democracy as the only legitimate form of political rule.

3.  **The Rise of Citizens' Moral Movements and Historical Exceptionalism:**
    *   The anti-slavery movement in 19th-century England is presented as a paradigm of a new phenomenon: large-scale, citizen-led movements mobilizing around moral issues to effect political change, reflecting deeply anchored universal concern.
    *   This era fostered a sense of **historical innovation and moral exceptionalism**, believing that "this age has brought about something unprecedented in history" in its recognition of these moral imperatives, seeing previous ages as "barbarous." While tempered by 20th-century atrocities, this belief in our civilization's higher standards persists, leading to implicit "double standards" in international moral judgment.

4.  **The Question of Sustaining Moral Drive:**
    *   The text acknowledges the immense, often escalating, demands flowing from these moral imperatives. It raises a crucial question: What can **sustain this continuing drive** for universal concern and benevolence, especially given inherent human limitations like restricted sympathies, self-preoccupation, and the tendency to define identity in opposition to "out groups"? This question is posed for future exploration.

5.  **Complex Interplay of Religious and Secular Moral Sources (Anglo-Saxon Context):**
    *   In Anglo-Saxon societies, the commitment to progress and reform was a **blend of Christian and Enlightenment ideas**.
    *   The anti-slavery crusade, for instance, originated in a **religious revival** (William Wilberforce, Clapham Sect), redefining Christian faith to include "intense practical concern" and social reform (e.g., linking godliness with an ordered social life).
    *   However, this deep commitment to reform could lead to **heterodoxy or secularization**, as reformers, clashing with cautious religious establishments, might challenge traditional doctrines (e.g., Henry Clarke Wright). This created a "mutually supportive opposition" between hyper-Augustinian Christianity and secular reform.
    *   Crucially, the author emphasizes that this was **not a "smooth, continuing, unidirectional move towards 'secularization'"**. The religious impetus often remained strong and recurred in later social justice movements (e.g., William Jennings Bryan, Martin Luther King Jr., the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament), demonstrating the complex, bi-directional relationship between religious and secular moral sources.

### Section 39

This section, "22.2," continues the discussion from "Our Victorian Contemporaries" by focusing on the **rise of unbelief** in Anglo-Saxon countries during the late nineteenth century. It argues that this period marked a fundamental shift from a worldview where belief in God was virtually unchallenged to one where theism became "one option among others," leading to "ontologically diverse" moral sources.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Critique of Standard Explanations for Unbelief:** The text challenges the common "scientistic" (loss of belief due to science) and "institutional" (loss of belief due to industrialization/modern economy) explanations. It argues these are insufficient because they implicitly assume religious belief is a "particulate illusory belief" that would collapse once its protective societal or intellectual scaffolding is removed.

2.  **The True Drivers of Victorian Unbelief:** While scientific discoveries (e.g., Darwin's theory of evolution, geology's immense age of the earth) certainly played a role, particularly in undermining the popular "argument from design" and challenging biblical literalism, the author argues the deeper cause was the emergence of a **new, militant moral outlook**.

3.  **The "Ethics of Belief" and its Moral Vision:** This new outlook, central to contemporary culture, revolved around an "ethics of belief," demanding that one "ought not to believe what one has insufficient evidence for." This principle drew strength from two ideals:
    *   **Self-responsible rational freedom:** An obligation to make up one's own mind without bowing to authority.
    *   **Heroism of unbelief:** A profound spiritual satisfaction derived from confronting a bleak, unconsoling truth with "manliness" and intellectual honesty. Prominent figures like Samuel Putnam and Thomas Huxley emphasized this courage and the "great sin" of "insincere profession."

4.  **Benevolence and Progress:** This "ethics of belief" was also linked to the demand for benevolence and human progress. Science was seen as a driver of technological advancement and human betterment (a tradition from Bacon). Unbelief was thus perceived not just as moral purity, but as a sacrifice made for the "onward march of the human race," liberating reserves of benevolence previously constrained by religious illusions. Thomas Huxley's personal testimony highlights this blend of scientific independence, ethical responsibility, and a "deep sense of religion... compatible with the entire absence of theology."

5.  **Critique of Later Scientism:** The author critiques later, more reductive forms of scientism (e.g., E.O. Wilson's sociobiology), showing how they attempt to reduce morality to genetically programmed "gut feelings," yet implicitly rely on a moral vision of "nobility" – a courageous detachment to see the "big picture" and transcend narrow egoism for human betterment, much like the Victorian agnostics. Bertrand Russell also embodied this ideal of an impartial, universal self aligned with the laws of nature, transcending conflict.

6.  **Alternative Moral Horizons:** The Victorian crisis of faith established an **alternative moral horizon** to traditional belief in God. Moral sources could now be sought in:
    *   The **dignity and powers of humanity** itself (disengaged reason, creative imagination).
    *   The **depths of nature** (within and without).

7.  **Two Paths to Unbelief (and a Third for Moral Sources):**
    *   **Scientistic Road:** Exemplified by Leslie Stephen, driven by the "ethics of belief," emphasizing scientific evidence and detachment.
    *   **Romantic/Goethean Path:** Exemplified by Matthew Arnold (influenced by Coleridge and Goethe), less driven by science, more by a quest for "expressive integrity" and a "more serviceable religion" through "culture." Arnold sought wholeness, a fusion of desire and significance, to replace traditional faith.
    *   **Culture as a Third Domain:** Arnold's vision of "culture" – uniting reason with moral/social passion for good, a "reason involving the whole personality" – emerges as a distinct source for moral demands in modernity, alongside traditional faith and scientistic agnosticism.

8.  **Revisiting Historical Exceptionalism (Sources of Moral Drive):** The section concludes by re-examining what underlies our sense of historical exceptionalism and our commitment to universal justice and benevolence, mapping potential answers onto the tripartite "map" of moral sources:
    *   **Judeo-Christian tradition:** *agape* and *grace*.
    *   **Enlightenment/Scientistic:** The belief that *disengaged reason*, *detachment from superstitions*, and the *courageous confrontation with a Godless universe* naturally lead to benevolence and universal welfare (as seen in Camus's Dr. Rieux or Dostoevsky's Versilov).
    *   **Rousseau/Romantic:** The idea of *natural sympathy* and an *inner impulse of nature* (benevolence transmuted by undistorted reason) as a deep, spontaneous source for good (Schiller, Hölderlin, 1960s counterculture). Kant's emphasis on *rational agency* and the demands of *universality* also fits here.

In essence, the section argues that the Victorian era didn't just see a decline in religious belief due to science, but a profound *moral transformation* that forged powerful new, secular, and quasi-secular moral outlooks and sources, which continue to shape our understanding of ethics and progress today.

### Section 40

This section delves into the complex interplay of modern moral sources and then pivots to a central conflict of modernity: the battle between Enlightenment and Romanticism, tracing the transformations of Romantic expressivism and its impact on art and our view of nature.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Amalgam of Moral Sources and the Rejection of Unilinear Secularization (Concluding 22.3):**
    *   Modern confidence in universal benevolence stems from various "substitutes for grace": scientific reason, Rousseauian/Romantic natural impulse, Kantian good will, and "Sarastrian goodness" (from Mozart's *Magic Flute*).
    *   In Anglo-Saxon cultures, these secular/quasi-secular sources often formed a complex **amalgam** with Christian faith and Enlightenment ideals (progress, rational control), driving movements for human improvement (e.g., temperance, world reconstruction). French contexts saw different "lay" mixtures.
    *   **Crucially, moral motivation is a complex mix of fusion, influence, and rivalry.** Secular ideas have influenced modern Christian *agape*, and vice-versa.
    *   The author explicitly rejects the notion of a "unilinear process called ‘secularization’," arguing that crises affect all moral sources, and weaknesses in one can strengthen others.

2.  **The Continuing Battle Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (22.4):**
    *   This ongoing conflict, manifest today in "technological" vs. "ecological" orientations, defines modern culture.
    *   **Romantic expressivism emerged as a protest** against the Enlightenment's ideal of disengaged, instrumental reason, which led to a "one-dimensional hedonism and atomism."
    *   **Criticisms of Enlightenment ideals:** Fragmentation of human life (reason/feeling, human/nature, human/human), reduction or occlusion of meaning, and undermining the cohesion necessary for free, participatory society (Schiller, Tocqueville). Tocqueville notably linked atomism to a danger for public liberty, advocating for civic engagement over self-enrichment.

3.  **Political Fruits and Perversions of Romanticism:**
    *   Romanticism fostered alternative political visions, grafted onto the civic humanist tradition (Tocqueville, Humboldt, Marx), which critiqued instrumental, bureaucratic, and industrial society.
    *   However, it also gave rise to **nationalism**. Rooted in Rousseau's idea of a sovereign "people" with a common purpose and Herder's concept of a *Volk* having a unique way of being and a duty to realize it (often based on language), nationalism provided a new basis for cohesion in post-hierarchical societies.
    *   **The "uglier side" of nationalism:** It can tragically combine appeals to "expressive integrity" (national personality) with ruthless instrumental reason and a drive for power, as exemplified by Nazi Germany. It also involves "wildly fictitious" historical narratives that shape collective identity.

4.  **Two Major Transformations of Romantic Expressivism:**
    *   **1. The Picture of Nature:** The original Romantic vision of nature as an expressive, meaningful, providential cosmic order (Schelling, Neo-Platonism, "visible Spirit") **eroded** in the 19th century. Scientific advancements (vast universe, Darwinian biology) presented a baffling, indifferent, and alien cosmos, leading to a "split-screen vision" where scientific explanation became disconnected from moral meaning. For some (Schopenhauer, Conrad), the inner impulse of nature became unfathomable, amoral, even terrifying. This creates a profound modern puzzlement about relating these two views.
    *   **2. The Relation of Art/Fulfillment to Morality:** The seeds of a breach between the fulfillment offered by art and traditional moral aspirations were present.

5.  **Visions of the Post-Romantic Age: Epiphanic Art (23.1 Introduction):**
    *   The "creative imagination" and **"epiphanic art"** (art as a creation/revelation of inaccessible, high moral/spiritual significance that defines and completes) remain central to modern culture. It's not mere mimesis.
    *   **Two Patterns of Epiphany:**
        1.  **Epiphanies of Being (Romantics):** Art portrays something (nature, emotion) to reveal a greater spiritual reality shining through it, making the object "translucent" (Wordsworth, Constable). Here, the work functions as a "symbol" (Coleridge: "translucence of the eternal in the temporal").
        2.  **Locus Shifted to Within the Work (20th-century Modernism):** The work itself becomes the self-contained, "auto-telic" locus of revelation, potentially portraying nothing external (Mallarmé: finding beauty in "nothingness").
    *   **Shared Characteristics of Epiphanic Art:** It embodies universal import in the particular, achieving an organic unity where form and content are inseparable (Schiller, Pater, Wilde, Yeats's "dancer and the dance"). The artist is a "seer," and art often takes the place of religion, promising depth, fullness, or wholeness of life.
    *   **Critique of Modernity:** Epiphanic art inherently critiques the "out of joint," "dead," mechanistic, and instrumental commercial-industrial-capitalist society (Schiller to Eliot).
    *   **Ambiguous Relation to Morality:** Schiller's work highlights a paradox: while beauty can aid moral will, it can also offer a *higher fulfillment* than mere morality, which is seen as partial; beauty aims to make us "whole" and free.

### Section 41

This section, "Visions of the Post-Romantic Age," continues the exploration of epiphanic art, delves into its inherent subjectivism, and begins to detail its transformations.

Here are the key points:

1.  **Beauty, Morality, and the Artist's Autonomy (Continuation of 23.1):**
    *   **Schiller's Paradox:** While beauty can aid moral will, it potentially offers a "higher fulfillment" that transcends or even repudiates traditional morality (Pater, Nietzsche).
    *   **Kant's Influence & Transmutation:** Kant defined beauty as "disinterested pleasure," distinct from utilitarian or moral demands, providing a basis for its independence from "the good." However, he ultimately subordinated it as a "symbol of the morally good." Romantic expressivism later leveraged this independence to challenge morality's primacy, exemplified by Wilde's declaration: "All the arts are immoral except those baser forms of sensual or didactic art that seek to excite to action of evil or good."
    *   **The Exceptional Artist:** Romantics portray the artist as an exceptional being offering epiphanies of great moral or spiritual significance, which may lie "beyond and against" received morality.
    *   **Artist's Suffering:** This rare sensibility often leads to suffering, foregone ordinary satisfactions, and a marginalized position ("crucifixion into isolate individuality" - D.H. Lawrence).
    *   **The Avant-Garde Myth:** The opposition between the visionary artist and a "blind," "philistine" society (commercial, capitalist) fosters the myth of the avant-garde: artists ahead of their time, misunderstood, but eventually recognized.
    *   **Bourgeois-Bohemia Collusion:** This myth also reveals a "collusion" between the bourgeois world and the artist's demi-monde. The bourgeois imagination is fed by art (e.g., Murger, Puccini), wanting its epiphanies but confining them, suppressing their anti-moral or anti-instrumental intent. This ambivalence arises because art offers spiritual nourishment when religion fails, preserving meaning even while negating bourgeois values.
    *   **Contemporary Corruption:** In the age of mass media and art markets, this "collusion" becomes almost open, blurring the lines and making integrity difficult to maintain, leading to a "certain corruption" as free self-expression becomes an advertising slogan.

2.  **Epiphanic Art: Continuity, Transformation, and Inherent Subjectivism (23.2):**
    *   **Core Argument:** "Epiphanic art" is a continuous understanding since the Romantic era, widely shared culturally. It's a "crucial locus of what I have been calling moral sources," providing spiritually significant fulfillment or wholeness.
    *   **Transformations in Poetics:** While the underlying "epiphanic" notion continues, its forms change. Wordsworth saw spiritual significance in the ordinary, using mimetic and expressive language. Later modern poetry (Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Imagists) broke from this, "deranging reference" and ceding "the initiative to words" to intensify the revelatory power of symbols, taking language beyond ordinary discourse.
    *   **Addressing "Anti-Romanticism":** The author counters the claim of a decisive break by "classicists" like Hulme and Eliot or austere Symbolists (Mallarmé, Rimbaud) who repudiated subject-centeredness.
        *   **Continuity:** Their work remains "epiphanic" in nature, even if the *content* or *what* is revealed changes (e.g., "impersonal," "life-alien" epiphanies).
        *   **Redefining Romantic Subjectivism:** Romantics weren't *only* about self-expression; they often articulated something greater (world, nature, being). Subjectivism primarily entered through the idea that access to this greater order comes via the "impulse of nature or the intimations of the spirit within" ("Inward goes the way full of mystery" - Novalis).
        *   **End of Unmediated Orders:** Unlike Renaissance Neo-Platonists (Bruno, Paracelsus) who believed in a public, unmediated spiritual order, moderns can only conceive of such an order "refracted" through the creative imagination. This "post-Kantian" understanding means reality is given in a medium inseparable from the artistic creation.
        *   **Inescapable Subjectivism:** The spiritual/moral order *must* be "indexed to a personal vision." The detachment of the spiritual from natural science, combined with the post-Romantic notion of the creative imagination, ends the possibility of unmediated orders. Thus, "radical reflexivity" and "inwardness of personal vision" are unbreakable parts of modern art.
        *   **The Central Task:** While direct "self-expression" can be avoided (e.g., Rilke's "The Panther" articulates the animal's inwardness as an emblem of *our own* alienated inwardness), the deeper challenge is to avoid "merely subjective" art, which can become a celebration of the artist's own creative powers rather than a revelation of something beyond the subject.

3.  **The First Transformation: Realism/Naturalism (23.3):**
    *   **Romantic Starting Point:** The Romantic moral vision celebrated the goodness of nature as a source of "grace" within, aiming for a "reconciliation from this enmity with nature" (Coleridge, Hegel). Epiphanies sought to reveal the spiritual goodness and healing power of the natural world, transfiguring the ordinary (Novalis, Shelley, Wordsworth, Constable).
    *   **Realism as a Negation and Continuation:** The first transformation, "realism" or "naturalism" (Zola, Flaubert, Courbet, Manet), emerged mid-19th century. While seemingly a counter-epiphanic art that denied spiritual reality and focused on "crude, lowly reality," it maintained continuity with Romanticism through a "transfiguratory intent."
    *   **The "Unveiling" of Reality:** Realism's premise is that we normally fail to see things through a "veil of illusion." Art provides a "fiercely veridical portrayal" to "break through the veil," an "unveiling" that reveals "the real face of things."
    *   **Transfiguration of Meaninglessness:** In works like Flaubert's *Madame Bovary*, this involves a "transfiguration" not of meaning, but of meaninglessness itself. By depicting the banality and illusion of deeper meaning with such power, the work gives "the meaningless and banal unhappiness the closure and shape of fate." The joy derived by the viewer comes from the power and freedom of being able to contemplate this truth, which frees them from entrapment. This process tends to exalt the creative power of the artist.
    *   **Courbet and the Dignity of the Ordinary:** Other realists like Courbet, in rejecting traditional genre hierarchies, endowed ordinary people (workers, peasants) with the monumental scope previously reserved for historical or sacred subjects. This "levelling move" itself constituted a transfiguration, a "negation of the ideal" that affirmed "the emancipation of the individual, and and finally to democracy."

### Section 42

This section, "Visions of the Post-Romantic Age," continues the exploration of epiphanic art by detailing three transformations of the Romantic vision of nature:

1.  **Realism/Naturalism: The Transfiguration of the Ordinary and Meaningless (Continuation of 23.3)**
    *   **Dignity of Raw Nature:** Works by Courbet ("Burial at Ornans," "Stonebreakers") elevate ordinary people and mundane events to historical significance, affirming the dignity of all humans and the "titanic force of raw nature." They portray not just deprivation but the intense "force and concentrated exertion" of physical labor, challenging "refined" spiritual judgments.
    *   **Embracing Basic Desire:** This art asserts the independence of "unrefined nature" and "basic desire" from traditional moral depreciation, advocating for their wholehearted embrace.
    *   **Artist's Power:** This "naturalist transfiguration" or "epiphany" arises from the artist's creative power, which "disenchantment of the world throws into relief." As Zola notes on Pissarro, the artist can draw "a rare poem of life and force from ordinary reality," transmuting the banal into poetry.
    *   **Connection to Impressionism:** This paradox—the artist's power alongside the subject's inherent force—forges connections with Impressionism's later explorations of how the artist transforms reality.

2.  **Baudelaire: The Epiphany of Anti-Nature (23.4)**
    *   **Rejection of Romantic Nature:** Baudelaire utterly rejects the Rousseauian/Romantic belief in nature's goodness and denies original sin, seeing "nature" as inherently criminal and "purely natural man" as "ghastly." He views nature, even flourishing, as "shameful and distressing," aligning with extreme Augustinian pessimism.
    *   **Art as Antidote to Decadence:** While apolitical, Baudelaire despises bourgeois commercial civilization. He seeks an antidote in art, which often replaces religion, opposing his world with an ideal of spiritual aristocracy, exemplified by Dandyism's heroic, almost absurd commitment to style.
    *   **Epiphanies of Ugliness and Evil:** Though acknowledging art's ability to find "bits of beauty" in fallen nature (via Neo-Platonism), Baudelaire often plunges into "evil and ugliness and decay." He sees Satan as a model of beauty and advocates for constant "intoxication" (with wine, poetry, or virtue) to escape the burden of time and banality.
    *   **Artist's Transmutative Power:** His most terrible poems often conclude with a "fierce undefinable joy," a "surge of power" stemming from the poet's capacity to transmute horror into meaning, akin to the Kantian sublime. He believes art must "correct nature" through imagination, creating an artifice that banishes the organic (seen as chaotic and evil) for the perfect inorganic. He acts as an alchemist, turning "mud" into "gold," often in a "God-forsaken world" illuminated solely by the poet's own imaginative powers.
    *   **"Art for Art's Sake" and Pure Art:** Baudelaire's stance is foundational to an "epiphanic art which is against nature," rooted in a "Platonist" desire for purity and a "Jansenist" sense of human fallenness. This led to an "exclusive" "l'art pour l'art" doctrine, inspiring Mallarmé's "pure" art, which seeks to free itself from nature, abolish ordinary things, and find "Beauty" in "Nothingness," celebrating the power of the word itself. This legacy influenced early Modernists like T.E. Hulme.

3.  **Schopenhauer: The Wild Energy of Amoral Nature (23.5)**
    *   **Reversal of Expressivism:** Schopenhauer presents a third transformation, relating art to "wild energy of an amoral nature." He takes the Romantic idea of nature as an expressive power (the "Will") but reverses its value.
    *   **The Will as Blind Striving:** The Will is not a spiritual good but "wild, blind, uncontrolled striving, never satisfied," driving humans to an "insatiable search for the unattainable," perpetuating itself through desires like sexual love (not for happiness). This "radical vitiation" of the source of reality makes humans miserable.
    *   **Liberation and Transcendent Purity:** This outlook, like Baudelaire's, parallels hyper-Augustinianism, degrading empirical reality to highlight the "transcendent purity of the good." It offers a "liberating" alternative to "Schillerian optimism" by acknowledging a universal human plight rather than personal inadequacy.
    *   **Art as Quieting the Will:** Schopenhauer diverges from Christian liberation (like Luther's), espousing a Buddhist outlook of escape from the self and the Will (nirvana). However, he offers a notion of *transfiguration through art*: by grasping "Ideas" (eternal forms), we can "quiet the will." Music is uniquely powerful, providing a "direct picture of the will itself."

### Section 43

This section continues the exploration of Schopenhauer's influence on post-Romantic art and introduces the broader theme of "self-affirmation" in the wake of the transformations of epiphanic art.

**I. Schopenhauer's Legacy and its Transmutation (Continuation of 23.5)**

*   **Transfiguration, not Release:** While Schopenhauer intended art to offer a momentary escape from the "miserable pressure of the will" and declare reality evil, his philosophy, as it permeated late-19th-century European culture (e.g., Wagner, Nietzsche, Mahler, Thomas Mann), was reinterpreted. For his followers, the focus shifted from *release from ego* to *transfiguration through art* as the ultimate "end and purpose of things."
*   **Nietzsche's Early "Justification":** The young Nietzsche, deeply influenced by Schopenhauer, argued that "only as an aesthetic product can the world be justified to all eternity," seeing nature achieve self-knowledge through man's creative expression.
*   **Persistent Expressivism:** Despite Schopenhauer's negation of nature's goodness, a key Romantic idea persisted: nature as a "great reservoir of force" (the "Dionysian"). While no longer spiritual, contact with this vital, amoral power is deemed essential to avoid "desiccation" and "emptiness," though it must be approached with caution due to its wildness. This idea became a significant legacy for 20th-century art (e.g., Fauvism, Surrealism, D.H. Lawrence) and also had "catastrophic" moral effects.
*   **Enhanced Expressive Powers:** The Schopenhauerian turn magnified the sense of human imaginative power to "refract and transfigure reality." Art, in this view, transmutes despiritualized reality, fallen nature, or the amoral will into beauty, rather than simply revealing an objectively independent good (though this was not true for Baudelaire or Schopenhauer himself, but for their followers as Neo-Platonism faded). This emphasis on the artist's power risks leading to "self-centred and subjectivist art."
*   **Influence on Inner Depths:** Schopenhauer also enriched the understanding of human inner depths, linking mental life to nature's "unbridled power." Freud, for instance, drew on this, with the Schopenhauerian will serving as an ancestor to the Freudian id. However, Freud adopted a "Cartesian stance" to objectify and understand these depths, aiming for liberation, even if his project ultimately blurred the lines between science and art.

**II. The Crisis of Affirmation and the Role of Creative Imagination (23.6)**

*   **The Challenge to "Goodness of Being":** The transformations described (Realism, Baudelaire's anti-nature, Schopenhauer's amoral will), combined with fading Christian theism and scientific "disenchantment," created a new climate where the original Romantic vision of spiritualized nature was less believable. Pessimistic outlooks (semi-Manichaean Baudelaire, total Schopenhauer) starkly challenged the deeply ingrained "goodness of being" upheld by Christianity, Platonism, and Enlightenment ethics.
*   **A Crisis for Affirmatives:** For the majority committed to the goodness of being, these views provoked a "crisis of affirmation," where the basis for benevolence and the value of human life seemed undermined or insufficiently grounded without a spiritual dimension.
*   **New Role for Imagination:** While returning to older creeds is an option, the post-Romantic emphasis on the *creative imagination's power to transfigure even base reality* suggests a new way forward. The crisis of affirmation might be met not just by recognizing an objective good, but by a **"transfiguration of our own vision,"** a transformation of our stance towards the world and self. This implies that the world's goodness may not be entirely independent of our *seeing* and *showing* it as good, drawing a parallel to the Judeo-Christian concept of God's creative seeing.
*   **Atheist vs. Christian Formulations:** This power of human "seeing" can be interpreted atheistically (man arrogating God's powers, as with Nietzsche) or within a Christian perspective (as with Dostoyevsky, linked to grace). Both, however, root this transformative power in the modern post-Romantic notion of the creative imagination.

**III. Three Illustrators of Self-Affirmation:**

*   **Kierkegaard (Either/Or):** Proposes an "ethical transfiguration" achieved by choosing oneself "infinitely"—a radical shift in stance that gives finite things value and overcomes despair and dread, leading to self-love. This is an *inward* transformation that doesn't change external life but gives it inwardness. Later writings link this transformation more explicitly to one's relation to God.
*   **Dostoyevsky:** Explores how humans "close or open themselves to grace." Self-closure, often driven by a noble loathing of the world's suffering (e.g., Ivan Karamazov's rejection of God's world), creates a vicious circle of self-loathing and destruction (leading to terrorism). Healing comes through *loving the world and ourselves* despite its evil, accepting responsibility ("we are all to blame"), and receiving love from others. This blends traditional Christian ideas of grace and love with the modern notion of the subject's power to bring about transfiguration through their stance.
*   **Nietzsche:** Aims to affirm *all* reality ("say 'yes' to it all") despite a cosmos of "blind, unspiritual, chaotic forces" (will to power). This "self-overcoming" allows the "superman" to bear the "eternal return" (no ultimate resolution) and transfigure the *meaning* of the world, even if its contents remain unchanged. Unlike Kierkegaard and Dostoyevsky, this strength comes *entirely from within*, overcoming Christian-derived morality that fosters self-hatred to affirm the inherent power of the will to power itself.

### Section 44

This section, "Visions of the Post-Romantic Age," concludes the discussion of Nietzsche and then introduces "Epiphanies of Modernism" (Chapter 24).

**I. Nietzsche, Self-Affirmation, and the Internalization of Moral Sources (23.6)**

*   **Nietzsche's Complex Affirmation:** While Nietzsche sought to move beyond mere aesthetic "justification" of the world (derived from Schopenhauer) to a full affirmation of reality, aesthetic transfiguration remains integral. The compelling aspect of his vision, especially in *Zarathustra*, is its beauty, which is not merely decorative but intrinsically linked to the "heroism" of accepting suffering, disorder, and the absence of justice. Affirmation and aesthetic transfiguration are inseparable for the visionary poet.
*   **Shared "Changed Stance" (Kierkegaard, Dostoyevsky, Nietzsche):** These three authors share the idea that a changed stance towards oneself and the world doesn't just *recognize* an existing good, but *helps to bring it about*. This is akin to the Genesis idea that "seeing good makes good."
    *   Dostoyevsky: Accepting to be part of the world contributes to its healing.
    *   Nietzsche: Affirming the will to power carries the will to a higher potency.
*   **Internalization of Moral Sources:** This "affirming power" is a further step in the internalization of moral sources. It emphasizes our inner capacity to construct, transfigure, or interpret the world, making our deployment of these powers essential for external sources (nature, God) to empower us. This internalization is more complete in atheist/naturalist theories like Nietzsche's.
*   **Nietzsche's Paradox:** Nietzsche presents a "cruel dilemma": the need for an affirming power stems from a commitment to an ethic of benevolence, yet he achieves his "yea-saying" by rejecting the ethic of benevolence, which he links to self-negating morality.

**II. Epiphanies of Modernism (24.1)**

*   **Two Paradoxical Characteristics:** Twentieth-century modernist art is marked by both a deep turn **inward** (exploring subjectivity, feeling, stream of consciousness, expressionism) and a **decentering of the subject** (art not merely self-expression, focus on language or poetic transmutation, dissolution of the conventional self). These seemingly opposed features are deeply connected.
*   **Continuity with Romantic Protest, but Amplified:** Modernists, like Romantics, protested against a world dominated by mechanism and instrumental reason. However, in the 20th century, the encroachments of technology, standardization, community decay, mass society, and vulgarization were far greater.
*   **Romantic Recourse No Longer Available:**
    *   **Nature as Counterweight:** Romantics found spiritual solace in nature and undistorted human feeling (e.g., Wordsworth, German Romantics). Epiphanic art revealed the spiritual reality behind nature.
    *   **Reasons for Un-tenability in Modernism:**
        1.  **Industrialization:** Urbanization, marginalization of nature, obliterated landscapes, machine-dominated human environments.
        2.  **Scientific Worldview:** Progress of mechanistic science, extended to life sciences.
        3.  **Shift in "Nature as Force":** Nature was increasingly seen through a Schopenhauerian lens of "amoral power," rather than spiritual reality.
    *   These changes made the old Romantic outlook "virtually untenable," both unbelievable and repudiated.
*   **Repudiation of Romanticism:**
    *   **Co-option by Bourgeois World:** Modernists saw Romanticism (especially through figures like J.S. Mill's synthesis of utilitarianism and expressivism, or Victorian sentimentality) as co-opted into bourgeois civilization, offering "trivialized, ersatz, or inauthentic meanings" to compensate for a spiritually hollow world.
    *   **New Inspirations:** Seeking a "purer, deeper, or stronger moral source," modernists often aligned more with **Baudelaire's** search for epiphany beyond "fallen nature," or **Nietzsche's** heroic virtues against "flabby humanitarianism." T.E. Hulme, influenced by both, attacked Romanticism for its "spilt religion" and denial of original sin.
    *   **Ambiguous Epiphanies:** Thinkers like Thomas Mann (influenced by Schopenhauer) presented epiphanies (e.g., in *The Magic Mountain*, *Death in Venice*) where beauty and harmony were profoundly ambiguous, often built on or leading to horror, decay, and death.
*   **The Turn to Interiority (Explaining Inwardness):**
    *   **Problem of Mechanism:** Faced with a world mechanistically determined (Munsterberg's view), the traditional epiphanic description of nature was no longer viable.
    *   **Recourse to the Lived World:** The "obvious recourse" was **interiority** – the lived world, as experienced and transmuted in sensibility and consciousness, which could not be assimilated to the machine.
    *   **Key Thinkers:** Bergson (irreducibility of experience/durée), Husserl's phenomenology (and later Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty), Wittgenstein, Polanyi. These movements sought to recover suppressed lived experience and creative activity, offering liberation and new stances towards the world.
    *   **Poetry's Role (Hulme):** Poetry, through fresh intuitive language and "poetic images," breaks through mechanical, conventional ways of seeing and restores "living contact with reality." This parallels Heidegger's combatting the "forgetfulness of Being."
*   **The Anti-Subjectivist Thrust (Explaining Decentering):**
    *   **Loss of Romantic Harmony:** The Romantic belief in a pre-established harmony between inner (spirit in man) and outer (spirit in nature) reality, where self-articulation aided world-revelation, became untenable. This was due to scientific biology, Schopenhauer's vision, and the Baudelairean rejection of inherent goodness.
    *   **Nature as Amoral Force:** What remained was Nietzsche's "immense amoral force" of nature (seen in Fauvism, Stravinsky, Lawrence), but this could not be identified with the whole, unified self. The Romantic alignment of inner nature and reason was gone.
    *   **Escape from the Unitary Self:** The modernist turn inward often meant moving *beyond* the self as usually understood, leading to fragmentation (Musil) or new forms of unity (Proust). The idea was that escaping the "single, unitary identity" (relied on by both disengaged reason and Romantic fulfillment) was necessary to retrieve lived experience and open oneself to "flux." Nietzsche, Lawrence, Hulme, Musil, Proust, and Joyce all explored this.
*   **Attack on Time-Consciousness and Narrativity:**
    *   **Spatialized Time:** Modernists critiqued the "homogeneous, empty time" of disengaged reason and scientism (e.g., Laplacean view), which spatialized time into discrete moments.
    *   **Lived Time:** Figures like Bergson, Heidegger (who emphasized "ek-stases" and the primacy of the future), and Lukacs (who linked capitalist "reification" to time becoming "space") protested in the name of "lived time."
    *   **Beyond Linear Narratives:** Modernist writers (Castorp in *The Magic Mountain*, Proust in *A la recherche du temps perdu*, Eliot, Pound) often rejected linear narratives of progress or decline, opting for non-linear, fragmented, or memory-driven structures to convey a deeper experience of time and meaning.

### Section 45

This section, "Epiphanies of Modernism," delves into how modernist art redefined the concept of epiphany in a world where Romantic spiritual solace in nature was no longer tenable.

Key points include:

*   **New Approach to the Past and Identity:** Modernists (Pound, Eliot) sought to "recapture" and make the past "come alive," not out of nostalgia for decline, but to achieve a fuller meaning across time, often through non-linear "juxtaposed" narratives (e.g., Tiresias in *The Waste Land*, Pound's *Cantos*). This involved a "profound breach in the received sense of identity and time" and "decentring of subjectivity."
*   **Displacement of Epiphanic Center:** The focus of epiphany shifted from the self to the "flow of experience," "new forms of unity," and language itself, often conceived as a "structure."
*   **"Subtler Language" of Juxtaposition:** Unlike Romantic descriptions, much modern poetry (from Symbolists onward) and visual art became non-descriptive, making things appear by "juxtaposing images or... words." The epiphany emerges from the "force field" between them, not through a central referent (e.g., Eliot's "Prufrock," non-representational art). This is deemed an "art of juxtaposition" rather than "transition."
*   **The Counter-Epiphanic Strand:** Some modernists rejected earlier "epiphanies of being," seeing them as inauthentic.
    *   **Eliot's** "Prufrock" brutally disappoints expectations of natural epiphany.
    *   **D.H. Lawrence** rejected "depth" and "obligatory significance," seeking liberation in the "meaninglessness of meanings" to find "the other dimension."
    *   **Pound's Imagism** emphasized "direct treatment of the 'thing'," advocating "hard and clear" presentation of distinct particulars to avoid "sloppy modes of thought" and "inauthentic meaning." This aligns with Nietzsche's idea of the Greeks "deep enough to stay at the surface of things."
*   **Naturalism's Unexpected Path to Experience:** Paradoxically, even naturalism, in its effort to reveal meaninglessness, still required artistic "transfiguration." This led to a "reflexive turn" that explored *how* reality is perceived. Impressionism, and later Cézanne, brought suppressed, tacit aspects of visual experience to light, making the "power of art to transfigure ordinary reality" a central theme and opening "new fields for epiphanic art."
*   **Indirect Epiphanies:** Unlike Romantics, post-Impressionists (Cézanne, Van Gogh, Expressionists) showed a "qualitatively new gap" between the object portrayed and what "shows through it." The epiphany became "indirect," of "something only indirectly available," which the visible object "only nudges us towards."
*   **Two Subjectivist Paths to "Richer Experience":**
    1.  **Futurism (Marinetti):** Embraced industrial civilization as an instrument of "untrammelled transforming will," glorifying technology, speed, and the "intoxication of power."
    2.  **Surrealism (Breton):** Advocated abandoning rational control and making a "dizzying descent into ourselves" to open up to deep unconscious forces, trusting in the "innocence of nature" to reveal hidden beauty and virtue.
    *   Both Futurism and Surrealism, though politically opposite, shared a desire for "unmediated unity" (world under will vs. ego merged with nature) and used "juxtaposition" to "crack the forms" of repressive traditions, seeking a "momentary, high state of excitement."
*   **High Modernism's Rejection of Immediate Unity:** Major modernists resisted the "subjectivist" pursuit of immediate unity, recognizing an "inescapable duality" and "uncollapsible distance between agent and world." They understood that "unmediated experience was an impossibility" and that we always perceive the world through constructed forms (influenced by Neo-Kantianism and Nietzsche's view of a chaotic "raw experience" requiring imposed order).
*   **Forms that Make Experience Vivid:** The solution was to distinguish between "deadened" and "vivid" forms.
    *   **Hulme** contrasted prose (dead images) with poetry (fresh "visual images" and "new bowl of metaphor") to "arrest us and make us actually see."
    *   **Pound's Ideogram theory** (though flawed) aimed to restore immediacy to language and preserve the past by embedding particulars within general terms. His poetics, through juxtaposition of "fragments" and "luminous details," framed insights for which there were "no words" (e.g., "In a Station of the Metro").
*   **Pound's Conception of Epiphany:** Pound's work shows a tension between reporting "constatation of fact" and capturing "emotion." The author concludes that for Pound, the "reality we are meant to report accurately on is not the bare scene, but the scene transfigured by emotion," implying that the epiphany is a revelation of this transfigured reality.

### Section 46

This section, "Epiphanies of Modernism," elaborates on the modernist redefinition of epiphany, moving from the traditional "epiphany of being" to an "interspatial" or "framing" mode.

**Pound's "Interspatial" Epiphany:**
The text highlights **Ezra Pound's poetics** as a prime example of this shift. For Pound, epiphany is not found *within* an object or word (as a direct expression of deeper reality) but rather *between* them. His concepts of the "vortex" and "ideogrammatic method" describe how words and images, placed in "exact juxtaposition," create a "force field" or "radiant node" that captures and radiates an intense energy. This energy is likened to electricity or radioactivity, and is identified with "the power of tradition, of centuries of race consciousness." Poetry, through this method, doesn't simply mimic reality but "liberates us from constricting conventional ways of seeing" to grasp deeper patterns. The goal is to make something *appear* and be present, even if it's "something only indirectly available." This requires a "hard-edged, clear, highly particularizing portrayal of the object" which, unlike an expressive object, stands "in its full opacity" to effectively frame the epiphanic space.

**Rejection of Romantic Expressivism:**
This "interspatial" mode fundamentally replaces the Romantic "epiphany of being," which was based on an expressivist view: that reality (nature, art) expresses or embodies an "unambiguously good moral source" or the self. Modernism, in contrast, negates this expressive relationship, seeing energies rather than purposes or ideas at play.

**Wider Resonances of "Framing Epiphany":**
The concept extends beyond Pound:
*   **Adorno and Benjamin:** They describe "constellations" – clusters of terms and images that create a space for the particular to emerge, hinting at reconciliation without achieving full "naming." Benjamin, in particular, favored **allegory over symbol**, recognizing the "gap between language and what it invoked," or the "distance...between sign and signified," unlike the Romantic symbol's "consubstantiality" with its meaning. Yet, like Symbolism, these constellations still reveal something otherwise inaccessible.
*   **Proust:** His "intertemporal" epiphanies (e.g., the madeleine) arise not from the initial experience, but from the framing of an event and its recurrence through memory, revealing a deeper reality "behind it."

**General Modernist Traits and the "Multi-levelled Consciousness":**
Modernism generally turns away from "epiphanies of being," which are characterized by: (1) showing reality as (2) an expression of (3) an unambiguously good moral source.
*   While Pound and others negate (2) (expression), figures like **Thomas Mann** (e.g., *Death in Venice*) negate (3) (unambiguously good moral source), presenting ambiguous epiphanies where beauty and decay are intertwined.
*   **Expressionist painters** negated both (3) and (1) (accurate representation).
This common thread leads to a "multi-levelled consciousness": an awareness of living on a "duality or plurality of levels" that are not fully compatible or reducible to unity (e.g., Mann's *Magic Mountain*'s incombinable time-consciousness). This "decentering" challenges the unified self (of disengaged reason or Romantic expression) and necessitates a "reflexive turn" that intensifies inwardness. Even when seeking transpersonal depths (mythic, archetypal), modernists emphasize that access to these is "only within the personal," through "a heightened awareness of personal experience."

**Art about Art and Modernism's Legacy:**
Modernism accentuates the artist's central role but makes the process of bringing forth epiphany "problematic and mysterious," leading to a new reflexivity where "art in the twentieth century has itself for its subject." This is seen in Rilke, who depicts transfiguration as a task laid upon us by the world, a "transaction between ourselves and the world."

The section concludes by discussing modernism's enduring influence and the dissociation of its various "strands" (e.g., anti-subjectivism, anti-humanism, anti-Romanticism, political reaction). While some (like Hulme, Pound, Eliot) combined these with political reaction, others (Adorno, Horkheimer, Auden, Brecht, Neruda) integrated modernist features into leftist stances, using its "pitiless stripping of Romantic illusion" to address public realities and hopes. Post-war poets like Różewicz and Herbert further exemplified this anti-Romantic, anti-aesthetic thrust, striving for a "nakedness" of language to confront a devastated world, finding a new kind of transfiguration in capturing even the most degraded reality for spiritual survival.

### Section 47

This section, "Epiphanies of Modernism," explores how modernist negation and different approaches to art's purpose lead to varied spiritual outcomes, critiquing certain postmodern interpretations, and clarifying modernism's distinct engagement with belief and personal vision.

**Key Points:**

*   **Negation as a Path to Epiphany:** The "counter-epiphanic" impulse, exemplified by Herbert's "stone" or Celan's austere "stripping down of language" and "winter images," is not a denial of epiphany but rather a way to "force us to the verge of epiphany." This extreme denuding aims to reach a "farther epiphany, beyond all the negations," hinted at by Celan's vision of "songs to be sung on the other side of mankind."
*   **Framing Epiphany and Formalism:** The "framing epiphany" focuses on the art *work itself* (auto-telic), which maintains its distinct existence and is *not* consubstantial with the deeper reality it reveals, unlike the Romantic symbol. While Formalist approaches (like Jakobson's view of poetry focusing on its medium) explored the internal relations of the work, they are deemed "gravely defective" for neglecting the epiphanic dimension and art's transformative power.
*   **Critique of Deconstruction and Postmodernism:** The text argues that certain de-centering and counter-epiphanic strands of modernism were later co-opted by philosophies like Derrida's deconstruction and Foucault's (early) work. These movements, influenced by a partial reading of Nietzsche, are criticized for celebrating "unconstrained freedom" and "endless free play" while disclaiming any notion of the good and neglecting modernism's "opening to epiphany." This "subjectivist self-celebration," also seen in Lyotard's "post-modernity," is characterized as the "least impressive side of modernism."
*   **Three Spiritual Profiles of Modernism:**
    1.  **Shallow Celebration:** A high estimate of the imagination's powers leading to self-celebration (e.g., Futurists, Surrealists). This is seen as a "standing temptation" that "plays itself out."
    2.  **New Forms of Epiphany:** A critique leading to a new kind of epiphany (e.g., Proust, Pound, Joyce, Eliot, Mann). These command respect and allegiance.
    3.  **Austere Discipline:** Renouncing comforting images to find language for the "horrible, degraded, or devastated" (e.g., Herbert, Celan), seeking a new transfiguration in stark reality. These also command respect.
*   **Modernism's Enduring Aspiration (24.6):** Modernism continues the Romantic aspiration to recover moral/spiritual sources against a fragmented, instrumentalist society, resisting purely "subjectivist" interpretations (like I.A. Richards' psychologistic view of poetry).
*   **The "Subtler Language" of Personal Vision:** Unlike earlier ages with "publicly established orders of references" (e.g., the "Great Chain of Being," shared religious beliefs), modern poets must articulate "personal vision." Metaphysics or theology are "indexed to a personal vision" and "refracted through a particular sensibility," making their engagement with truth "ineradicably personal."
*   **Displacement onto Words:** Due to this shift, the "centre of gravity is displaced onto the words" themselves. The "energy" captured in these words is defined by attending to the language, akin to the invocative power of ritual rather than propositional belief.
*   **Poetry as Redemption:** Ultimately, the text highlights Wallace Stevens' idea that "after one has abandoned a belief in God, poetry is the essence which takes its place as life’s redemption," encapsulating modernism's struggle and solution to finding meaning in a world without traditional public references.

### Section 48

This section, a concluding reflection on the "portrait of the modern identity," justifies the author's historical approach, arguing it reveals implicit influences (Romanticism in modernism, spiritual roots of naturalism) and the complex connections between moral outlooks, concepts of the self, inwardness, and societal structures. The aim is to foster self-understanding and insight into contemporary debates.

The author identifies **three major zones of tension or conflict in modern moral culture**:
1.  **The issue about sources:** Underlying agreement on moral standards, there's uncertainty and division regarding the fundamental "constitutive goods."
2.  **The issue about instrumentalism:** The conflict between "disengaged instrumentalism" (which empties life of meaning and threatens public freedom) and the "Romantic or modernist protest" against it. Modernism transformed the conception of creative imagination, epiphany, and the realities they access, thereby altering alternatives to disengaged reason.
3.  **The issue about morality:** A more recent tension, questioning whether moral standards are *incompatible* with a richer, aesthetic, or expressive fulfilment. While early Romanticism (e.g., Schiller) saw compatibility, later developments (Schopenhauer, Baudelaire, Nietzsche) challenged this, raising the possibility that artistic epiphany might draw us to different things than morality demands (e.g., Pound's politics implicitly revealing such conflict). This issue is central to some "post-modern" writers like Derrida and Foucault.

The section then delves into the **second issue – the critique of disengaged instrumentalism** – since the Romantic period. Instrumentalism is attacked for its negative:
*   **Experiential consequences:** It "empties life of meaning" (e.g., no room for heroism, loss of passion, Nietzsche's "pitiable comfort" of the "last men"). This can be through mass media occluding deeper meanings, consumer society fostering a "merely instrumental stance," or the destruction of traditional communities ("iron cage" - Weber, Marx).
*   **"Disenchantment" (Weber):** The world loses its "magic" or sacred quality, becoming a "neutral domain of potential means."
*   **Fragmentation:** It divides us from nature, within ourselves (reason vs. sense), and from each other (atomistic focus).
*   **Loss of Resonance/Depth:** Modern objects are ephemeral commodities replacing lasting, expressive ones (Marx, Berman, Borgman, Arendt, Rilke's *Duino Elegies*). Individuals are extracted from rich community life into transient, partial associations.
*   **Public consequences:** It destroys public freedom (Tocqueville), generates unequal power relations (Marx), and fosters ecological irresponsibility.

The author then offers his **perspective on these conflicts**, criticizing common views for their "narrow sympathies" and tendency to invalidate crucial goods. He argues that the "modern identity" is so pervasive (combining disengaged reason, creative imagination, freedom, self-fulfilment, benevolence) that even those who repudiate parts of it often live by what they deny – a form of "delusion."

He critiques:
*   **Extreme proponents of disengaged reason:** They are "massively blind" to underlying goods like intrinsic purpose, expressive unity, and non-instrumental value in nature, dismissing complaints as illusory and viewing public problems solely as technical.
*   **Human-centred expressive fulfilment (e.g., some Marxism, Frankfurt School):** While more sympathetic, it's "too narrow" and "entirely anthropocentric," reducing or negating non-anthropocentric sources of meaning explored by key modernists (Rilke, Proust, Mann, Eliot, Kafka), tying art too closely to subjectivism despite many modernists opposing it.
*   **Contemporary subjectivist expressivism ("triumph of the therapeutic"):** Rooted in Romanticism (Emerson, Whitman) and Enlightenment naturalism's defense of self from external spiritual demands, combined with faith in therapy. This leads to "shallowness," where non-anthropocentric goods are dismissed in favor of self-realization, reducing moral language to "colourless subjectivist talk of 'values.'" Ultimately, if nothing but self-fulfilment is important, self-realization becomes empty, and it reinforces instrumentalism's negative effects on community affiliations and solidarities.

### Section 49

This section, continuing the author's exploration of "Conflicts of Modernity," critiques various contemporary perspectives for their "narrow sympathies" and "selective blindness," particularly regarding moral sources and the "experiential consequences" of instrumentalism.

**1. Critique of Subjectivist Expressivism (Continued):**
The author concludes his critique of subjectivist expressivism (focused on self-fulfilment and revocable affiliations), arguing it leads to:
*   **Erosion of Public Life:** Weakens political community, fosters procedural fairness over strong identification, and ironically strengthens the instrumental, bureaucratic world it aimed to challenge.
*   **Abdication of Autonomy:** Can lead to over-reliance on "helping professions" (as Foucault described) and a diminished "time sense" due to transient relationships. While self-fulfilment is a good, its exclusive pursuit makes life thin and ultimately self-defeating.

**2. Critique of Anti-Subjectivist Readings (Bellah & Habermas):**
The author then turns to anti-subjectivist perspectives, finding them also inadequate:
*   **Bellah's *Habits of the Heart*:** Is criticized for prioritizing "public consequences" (loss of Tocquevillian commitment) and implicitly assuming that resolving these public issues would *also* resolve the "independent problem of the loss of meaning" (experiential issues like disenchantment or loss of substance). This "elides" a crucial area of modern concern.
*   **Habermas's *Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns*:** While praised for correcting Adorno's pessimism about instrumental reason's public control by emphasizing inter-agent communication, Habermas similarly "elides the experiential problem under the public." His framework for modernity (scientific, practical, expressive integrity) lacks a coherent place for "an exploration of the order in which we are set as a locus of moral sources"—a search pursued by artists like Rilke or Pound, which relies on "personal resonance" to access an order beyond purely objective or subjective categories.

**3. Critique of Anti-Modernist/Straussian Views:**
These views, critical of both instrumental and Romantic-expressive modernity, are deemed too narrow and unsympathetic. They distort the aspiration for expressive fulfilment by focusing on its "least impressive, most trivializing offshoots" and overlook genuine moral visions. The author stresses that a good's validity (e.g., subjective fulfilment) is not negated just because its *exclusive pursuit* leads to negative outcomes; rather, it indicates a need for it to be integrated with other goods, even if this creates difficult dilemmas.

**4. The Author's Central Argument: The "Exploration of Order Through Personal Resonance":**
The author argues that all these dominant interpretations are "too narrow" because they collectively fail to acknowledge the validity of "the exploration of order through personal resonance." This approach is the "especially unlucky target" that "falls through all the grids" (including Weber's).
*   **Necessity:** In an age where a "publicly accessible cosmic order of meanings is an impossibility," this personal, resonant exploration is the *only way* to define moral sources, clarify questions of meaning, and address experiential issues (like a resonant human environment or deep affiliations).
*   **Role of Art and Language:** This exploration is vital for epiphanic art and for critical/philosophical work (like his own) that uses resonant language to clarify issues and make contact with moral sources. To dismiss this is a "huge self-inflicted wound."
*   **Moral Implications:** This dismissal has serious moral consequences, as it's rejected by disengaged reason, anti-moderns (who assimilate it to subjectivism), and stern moralists (who try to contain it, often via proceduralist morality or certain theological outlooks). However, while basic modern moral standards (rights, justice) don't depend on it, many *other important issues of life* do, including ecological responsibility (e.g., Rilke's vision of the world making claims on us beyond human utility).

**5. The Issue of Moral Sources (First Zone of Tension):**
The discussion then shifts to the first major zone of tension: the problem of underlying moral sources. While there's broad societal agreement on stringent moral norms (justice, benevolence, human rights), there's uncertainty and disagreement on their fundamental "constitutive goods."
*   **Problem of "Benevolence on Demand":** Experiencing high moral standards merely as peremptory demands or obligations (generating guilt or self-satisfaction) is morally corrupting. It lacks a "strong sense that human beings are eminently worth helping or treating with justice"—a positive affirmation of their value.
*   **Nietzsche's Challenge:** Without such positive affirmation (like Christian *agapé* or its secular successors), Nietzsche's critique holds: pity is destructive, degrading, and an ethic of benevolence is indefensible.
*   **Dangers of Negative Morality:** This "benevolence on demand" can lead to projecting evil outward, political extremism, polarization, and masked hatred, as powerfully depicted by Dostoevsky.
*   **Questions for Modernity:** The author raises critical questions about whether modern society is "living beyond its moral means," questioning the credibility and power of naturalist/Enlightenment "seeing-good" to sustain high moral standards, especially in the face of suffering or the "irremediably broken," suggesting these secular sources may be parasitic or inadequate compared to a spirituality rooted in divine affirmation.

### Section 50

This section continues the author's exploration of moral sources and introduces the third major zone of tension in modern moral culture.

**1. Moral Sources: Naturalist Humanism vs. Theistic Perspective:**
The author reiterates his lean towards a **theistic perspective** (specifically Judaeo-Christian theism, as explored by Dostoevsky) having incomparably greater potential than naturalist humanism for sustaining moral commitments to benevolence and justice. He clarifies that his aim is not to "score points" but to highlight the crucial questions about moral sources, which are often **obscured by proceduralist meta-ethics** that reduce morality to obligation rather than a positive affirmation of human worth.

**2. The Third Zone of Tension: Morality vs. Other Goods (e.g., Aesthetic/Expressive Fulfilment):**
This conflict arises from:
*   **A plurality of goods:** Acknowledging that different moral outlooks often delegitimize goods that conflict with their primary focus (e.g., instrumentalists ignoring expressive fulfilment, critics of modernity dismissing subjective fulfilment).
*   **The high cost of benevolence:** Drawing on Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, the author notes that high demands of benevolence can conflict with self-love and self-fulfilment, potentially leading to self-destruction or violence. This tension is historically evident in naturalist revolts against ascetic religious demands.
*   **Modern articulations of the conflict:** Foucault and feminist critiques highlight how high ethical and spiritual ideals can be interwoven with exclusions, domination, and the subordination of certain groups (e.g., women).

**3. The "Poisoned Chalice" of Lofty Ideals:**
The author posits a "general truth": **the highest spiritual ideals and aspirations also threaten to lay the most crushing burdens on humankind**, acting as "poisoned chalices" that have caused immense misery and savagery throughout history, whether from religious zeal or secular millenarist ideologies (e.g., the Kharkov famine, the Killing Fields).

**4. Critique of "Sober, Scientific-Minded, Secular Humanism":**
While acknowledging the value of the "neo-Lucretian stance," the author finds this solution "too simple." He argues that a "cardinal mistake" of many naturalist and Nietzschean critiques is to **invalidate a good based on its destructive consequences.** He insists that some potentially destructive ideals are genuinely directed towards valid goods (e.g., the ethics of Plato, the Stoics, or the appeal of the Gospel).

**5. The Dilemma of "Mutilation":**
Adopting a "stripped-down secular outlook" to avoid the dangers of high ideals does not escape the dilemma but rather involves its own **"mutilation"** by stifling humanity's deepest spiritual aspirations, which comes at a "heavy price." While prudence might suggest a safer, scaled-down existence, this denies a part of our humanity. The author concludes that **most outlooks promising to resolve these conflicts without such costs are based on "selective blindness."**

**6. The Author's Vision: Retrieval and Hope:**
Despite the inherent difficulties, the author frames his work as an act of **"retrieval" and "liberation."** He believes that modern culture, driven by prudence (post-millenarist destruction), naturalism, and partisan narrowness, stifles the spirit by burying essential human goods. His aim is to uncover these "buried goods through rearticulation" to empower the spirit. He expresses **hope that the dilemma of spiritual "mutilation" is not an "iron fate" but our "greatest spiritual challenge,"** a hope he sees implicit in Judaeo-Christian theism's promise of divine affirmation. The ultimate goal of his overall Conclusion is to demonstrate how his picture of modern identity illuminates our contemporary moral predicament.

### Section 53

This section, Part 53 of 58, continues the pattern of bibliographic references and footnotes from the previous sections (51 and 52).

It primarily consists of notes corresponding to three chapters of the main document:
*   **Chapter 14: Rationalized Christianity**: These notes extensively reference the works of **John Locke** (e.g., *An Essay concerning Human Understanding*, *Two Treatises of Government*, *The Reasonableness of Christianity*), discussing his views on reason, natural law, religion, property, and his relationship to both orthodox Calvinism and Deism. It also includes critiques of Locke by contemporaries like Shaftesbury and Stillingfleet.
*   **Chapter 15: Moral Sentiments**: This part cites works related to the **Cambridge Platonists** (e.g., Hobbes, Cudworth, Whichcote) and then focuses heavily on **Shaftesbury** and **Francis Hutcheson**. The notes cover themes such as the origins of morality, the concept of a "moral sense," benevolence, self-interest, and the nature of happiness.
*   **Chapter 16: The Providential Order**: These notes include further references to Hutcheson, as well as broader discussions on religious concepts of divine providence, holiness, and the nature of God, drawing on sources from Catholic catechism, ancient paganism, Judaism (Philo), and Puritan thought.

In essence, this section provides the scholarly apparatus (citations, brief elaborations) for discussions on key thinkers and concepts in the development of Western thought regarding reason, religion, and morality, particularly from the 17th and 18th centuries.

### Section 54

This section, Part 54 of 58, continues the pattern of bibliographic references and footnotes, covering notes for Chapters 16, 17, 18, and 19.

**Key points and themes:**

*   **Chapter 16: The Providential Order (continued)**
    *   Further exploration of Deism, referencing figures like Matthew Tindal, and its conceptual challenges, particularly regarding theodicy in the face of events like the Lisbon earthquake.
    *   Examines the influence of Alexander Pope's *An Essay on Man*, highlighting ideas like the Great Chain of Being and the belief that "Whatever IS, is RIGHT," supported by Leibniz's theodicy.
    *   Discusses Adam Smith's efforts in *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* to synthesize earlier theories, incorporating concepts of moral sentiments, sympathy, utility (Hume), the "impartial spectator," and a vision of the universe as a "divine machine," drawing on Stoic inspiration.
    *   Distinguishes between a "Deism of extrinsic law and calculation" (Locke) and a "Deism of sentiment" (Hutcheson), noting their shared belief in a harmonized, providential universe.

*   **Chapter 17: The Culture of Modernity**
    *   Shifts focus to broader cultural transformations that mark modernity.
    *   Highlights the rise of the novel (Ian Watt) and its role in shaping new sensibilities.
    *   Emphasizes the evolving concept of family intimacy and individualism (Philippe Ariès, Tocqueville), which undermined earlier hierarchical social structures and led to the creation of private, intimate spaces.
    *   Explores the impact of Rousseau on the "philosophy of sentiment" and the appreciation of nature, linking it to concepts of natural goodness and freedom.
    *   Discusses the emergence of the aesthetic of the "sublime" (Burke, Kant) as tied to subjective response and the sense of unbounded moral power.

*   **Chapter 18: Fractured Horizons**
    *   Reflects on the complex, circular relationship between philosophical formulations and broader cultural movements, using Rousseau's influence on sentiment and nature as a prime example.
    *   Addresses the decline of deeply rooted traditional beliefs, such as the obviousness of immortality and the reality of hell, and how later thinkers (like Butler and Kant) attempted to rationalize or bolster these beliefs as their foundational certainty eroded.

*   **Chapter 19: Radical Enlightenment**
    *   Focuses on the "Radical Enlightenment," detailing the contributions of figures like Jeremy Bentham, Paul-Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, Denis Diderot, and Marquis de Condorcet.
    *   Explores the development of utilitarianism, radical materialism, and a rejection of traditional religious morality based on divine command.
    *   Proposes a new ethical framework founded on human reason, utility, and a scientific understanding of human nature, aiming for social progress and human perfection.
    *   Notes Diderot's nuanced views on primitivism versus civilization, and the ideal of an "impartial benevolence" (Adam Smith's "impartial spectator") as a moral compass.
    *   Includes discussions on reductionism, the philosophical implications of Lucretius, and the shift towards an "immortality of fame" as a significant cultural development in the Enlightenment, linking it to classical models and revolutionary ideals.

### Section 55

This section, Part 55 of 58, provides detailed bibliographic references and footnotes for three chapters: "Nature as Source" (Chapter 20), "The Expressivist Turn" (Chapter 21), and "Our Victorian Contemporaries" (Chapter 22).

**Chapter 20: Nature as Source**
This chapter's notes center on **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**, highlighting his philosophy concerning nature, innate conscience, and moral sentiment. Key themes include:
*   Rousseau's argument for an inherent "voice of conscience" and the innateness of moral sentiment (loving the good once reason apprehends it).
*   His unique form of Deism, which emphasizes the love of divine order and rejects miraculous interventions, contrasting with the materialist views of figures like Holbach and Diderot.
*   The profound emotional and social dimensions of Rousseau's thought, including his evocative descriptions of communal feeling and patriotism.
*   Exploration of the self, with references to parallels between Rousseau's *Confessions* and Augustine's writings.

**Chapter 21: The Expressivist Turn**
These notes delve into **Romanticism**, characterizing it as a major "expressivist turn" in Western thought. Key aspects include:
*   The deep interconnectedness between humanity and a vital, dynamic natural world, where "All thinking things... rolls through all things" (Wordsworth) and there's a longing to be "one with All" (Hölderlin).
*   The role of the poet and artist in articulating not merely subjective feelings, but a larger, underlying reality, often through symbolism and the transformative power of imagination (Herder, Novalis, Shelley).
*   A shift in aesthetics, defining beauty and the sublime in terms of subjective human responses rather than objective rational principles (Abbé du Bos, Hutcheson, Burke, Kant).
*   The emergence of a quasi-messianic or transformative aspiration linked to this expressivist understanding, aiming to reshape both individual and societal experience.

**Chapter 22: Our Victorian Contemporaries**
This final set of notes examines the social and moral landscape of the Victorian era, linking it to the preceding philosophical developments. Central themes are:
*   The widespread erosion of traditional hierarchies and absolutist political structures, giving way to more egalitarian and liberal ideals.
*   A notable rise in humanitarianism and moral sensitivity to suffering, often perceived as a distinguishing feature of "civilized" modernity, though critiqued by figures like Nietzsche as a form of weakness.
*   The complex interplay between declining religious belief (especially the rise of agnosticism and atheism) and the formation of new, human-centered ethical frameworks. Figures like Feuerbach are cited for promoting an "anthropocentric" morality, where unbelief releases "moral treasures" for human self-affirmation.
*   The anxieties of modernity, including the loss of traditional faith and the search for new foundations for meaning and morality (Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach").
*   The impact of scientific thought, particularly evolutionary theory, on understanding human nature and morality (E. O. Wilson).

In essence, these sections trace a profound intellectual and cultural transformation from Rousseau's emphasis on innate moral sentiment and a deistic natural order, through Romanticism's deepening of subjective experience and expressive connection to a vital nature, culminating in the Victorian era's social liberalization, heightened humanitarian ethics, and the complex challenge of forging meaning and morality in an increasingly secular and scientifically informed world.

### Section 56

This section, Part 56 of 58, comprises detailed bibliographic references and footnotes for Chapters 23 ("Visions of the Post-Romantic Age") and 24 ("Epiphanies of Modernism"), tracing the intellectual and artistic currents from the late Romantic period through the early 20th-century avant-garde.

**Chapter 23: Visions of the Post-Romantic Age**

This chapter's notes highlight the complex transition from Romantic ideals to a more critical, anxious, and often darker worldview:

*   **Critique of Reason and Society:** References to Rousseau (*Discours sur l'inégalité*) underscore his argument that reason and reflection generate self-love (*amour-propre*), isolate individuals, and diminish natural human empathy, contrasting "savage man" with "philosophical man."
*   **Aesthetic Autonomy:** Schiller's *Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man* are cited for the concept of "play" as essential to human fulfillment and the idea of auto-telic (self-sufficient) art, a precursor to "art for art's sake" (Mallarmé).
*   **Anxieties of Modernity:** Tocqueville's critique of the "passion for well-being" leading to servitude, and references to Joseph Conrad's *Heart of Darkness*, reflect growing unease with modern society and its psychological depths.
*   **Cultural and Political Shifts:** The rise of linguistic nationalism (Herder, Benedict Anderson) and the emergence of "Bohemian" subcultures (Jerrold Seigel) as spaces of artistic and social experimentation are noted.
*   **Realism and Irony:** The shift towards realism in art and literature is evident in references to Flaubert (ironic depth in *Madame Bovary*) and Courbet (rejecting idealization for an "obtrusive" painted reality).
*   **Baudelaire: The Transitional Figure:** Extensive references to Baudelaire highlight his exploration of urban life, modern beauty and ugliness, sensory "correspondences," and the artist's role in extracting meaning from the ordinary and the grotesque, bridging Romanticism and Modernism.
*   **Existential and Moral Crisis:** Key figures like Nietzsche (critique of morality, "will to power," nihilism), Dostoyevsky ("God is dead" dilemmas, existential freedom), and Kierkegaard (individual authenticity, choice in the face of angst) are cited for their profound challenges to traditional moral and religious frameworks.

**Chapter 24: Epiphanies of Modernism**

This section documents the radical aesthetic and philosophical shifts of early 20th-century Modernism:

*   **Anti-Romanticism:** T. E. Hulme is a central figure, explicitly rejecting "slushy" Romantic sentimentality and optimism, advocating for "heroic values," an "intensive" art form, and a view of man as "inherently limited," influenced by Nietzsche.
*   **Flux, Fragmentation, and Subjectivity:** The influence of philosophers like Bergson and William James, along with new concepts in physics, fostered a modernist perception of time, consciousness, and reality as fluid, subjective, and fragmented (Proust's memory, Virginia Woolf's "luminous halo," T. S. Eliot's layered consciousness).
*   **Avant-Garde Aesthetics and Violence:**
    *   **Futurism (Marinetti):** Glorified speed, technology, urban dynamism, and war ("the world's only hygiene"), advocating for the destruction of tradition, museums, and libraries, and expressing anti-feminist, authoritarian views.
    *   **Dadaism and Surrealism (Breton):** Explored the unconscious, dream logic, and automatic writing, aiming to liberate psychic activity from rationality and responsibility, though also revealing a latent, almost revolutionary, violence in their manifestos.
*   **Modernist Poetics:** Emphasized the "juxtaposition of distinct images" (Hulme), a desire to capture the essence of "a whole civilization" (Joyce), and to transmit "a new world" from everyday appearances (Wordsworth, as a precursor to modernist perception).
*   **Philosophical Underpinnings:** References to Heidegger's concepts of Being and time, and post-structuralist critiques from Foucault and Lyotard, suggest the broader intellectual context challenging traditional knowledge and authority.

In essence, these notes trace a trajectory from the internal critique and anxieties of the post-Romantic era, marked by a questioning of reason and an exploration of existential dilemmas, into the radical, often iconoclastic, and sometimes politically charged aesthetic revolutions of early Modernism, which embraced fragmentation, subjectivity, and new forms of expression while consciously rejecting past traditions.

### Section 57

This section, Part 57 of 58, comprises detailed notes, first continuing the discussion of **Modernist aesthetics and philosophy** from previous chapters, and then providing the bibliographic foundation for the **Conclusion: The Conflicts of Modernity.**

**Key Points on Modernist Aesthetics and Philosophy (Notes 63-95):**

*   **Eliot and Pound's Anti-Realism:** Both poets rejected simple realism, advocating for an art that "intensifies the world to his emotions" while striving for a "continual extinction of personality" to produce a "new art emotion."
*   **Spatialization of Time and Framing Epiphany:** Building on Joseph Frank's concept, the notes highlight a modernist rejection of linear narrative in favor of a "spatialization of time." This involves "framing epiphanies" that unite disparate moments (historical, mythical) into a "timeless present" or through archetypes, offering a "transhistorical unity" that connects to "the highest spiritual articulations of different ages." This approach, unlike a mechanistic "Laplacean world-view," is "situated" within time.
*   **Poetics of Juxtaposition:** This technique (linked to Apollinaire's "simultanism") aims to counter the sense of time as disconnected instants, extending the present into an "ephemeral eternity" and allowing access to "deeper, unnamed feelings" that form the "substratum of our being."
*   **Modernist Use of History:** Eliot and Pound, while critical of the modern age's "dissociation of sensibility," departed from Romantic narratives. Their epiphanies aim to make the perennial "radiate again in our time," identifying it (for Eliot) with a "timeless" religious vision.
*   **Post-Structuralist Critiques and "Free Play":** References to Foucault, Derrida, and Lyotard discuss philosophical challenges to subjectivity and presence. Derrida's concept of "free play" is described as exalting "indefinite freedom of play" and presenting itself as a "liberating doctrine," though its anti-humanism is noted as "antipodal to Schiller's" humanist notion of play.
*   **"Second Fall of Man":** Stephen Spender's concept describes a "Second Fall" resulting from the dominance of "scientific utilitarian values" that replace personal moral choice with assessments of social usefulness or destructiveness.
*   **Tacit Knowledge and Situated Experience:** References to Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, and Polanyi emphasize the importance of the "background" or "tacit dimension" of knowledge, rooted in lived, embodied experience rather than purely disengaged reason.

**Key Points for the Conclusion: The Conflicts of Modernity (Notes 1-32):**

*   **Critiques of Modernity and Technology:** This concluding chapter draws upon critical voices like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche (on "wretched comfort"), Max Weber (on the "iron cage" of rationalization), Marshall Berman, and Hannah Arendt to highlight the anxieties and challenges posed by modern life, technology, and rationalization.
*   **Ethics and Post-Structuralism:** The author notes that even post-structuralist critiques (e.g., Foucault, Derrida) implicitly rely on an "ethic of non-domination," suggesting an enduring ethical horizon despite their anti-humanist stances.
*   **Tocquevillian Themes and the "Therapeutic":** Extensive references to Tocqueville and the concept of "the triumph of the therapeutic" (Rieff, Lasch, MacIntyre, Sheehy) underscore a major theme: the contemporary focus on individual self-fulfillment, personal growth, and emotional well-being. This "therapeutic" ethos seeks to integrate expressive private life with instrumental work, posing challenges to traditional communal and moral frameworks.
*   **Nuance in Modernity:** The author suggests the need to avoid overly negative dismissals of the "Enlightenment project" and to approach "subjectivist" tendencies in contemporary culture with a balanced perspective. The section also critiques the modern meta-ethic's overemphasis on "obligation."
